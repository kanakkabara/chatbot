{"headline": "Google Cloud Healthcare API to address medical reord interoperability", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "Google has already organized the world's search results. Now, it's moving on to medical information.  The company's cloud business has set its sights on helping customers aggregate medical data, whether it's labs, medical records or X-ray imaging. All of this information is currently scattered throughout the various hospitals and clinics where patients receive care, and is a huge pain for doctors, nurses and patients to access.  That leads to all sorts of duplicate tests and procedures, which is expensive. And it can create dangerous information gaps, such as if a health system can't easily access a medical record with a full rundown of a patient's allergies.  Google Cloud is trying to address through a new application programming interface or \"API\" that it says can ingest all of the important health-care data types. And it has lined up several hospital partners for its early access program, including Stanford School of Medicine.  \"I see the impact that availability of data can have in medicine, and the need for it is urgent,\" said Greg Moore, Google Cloud's vice president of health care. Moore is a doctor with an informatics background who was recruited from Geisinger Health by Google cloud chief Diane Greene.  \"Getting data to patients, caregivers and providers is key,\" he said. \"And that's why we're so excited about it.\"  Google's cloud business is competing with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the multibillion-dollar health sector. Health care is particularly attractive to these companies as it's one of the few remaining industries that hasn't fully yet transitioned to the cloud.  Apple is also working on an effort to get health information to the people who need it most.  But Apple's approach is a bit different in that it puts patients in the center by giving them consent to request their records from their medical institution on the iPhone. Google is working through its industry partners.  This isn't the first time Google set its sights on health data.  It has tried to tackle the problem once before with Google Health, which shut down in 2011 for a variety of reasons (for one thing, a lot of people's medical information was still stored on paper). Since then, most doctors have now fully transitioned to digital systems. But that doesn't mean that data is easy to transfer from one health system to another.  \"We want to nudge the industry forward and provide our tool as a call to action,\" Moore said.", "author": "Christina Farr", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/05/google-cloud-healthcare-api-to-address-medical-reord-interoperability.html"}
{"headline": "Sand In My Shoes - February Update | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "SummaryFebruary was a tough month for equities and the Sand In Shoes portfolio was not immune to the market forces.The total value of my portfolio was down over 3% for the month of February.However, that was offset with the largest month, dividend-wise, I have had to date.My IRA portfolio lost over $8,000 (3.1%) in value in the month of February, shaving off what I gained in January and then some. However, given that the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.9% I am somewhat pleased by my decision to allocate a fair amount of my retirement money to fixed income instruments.I made one addition to the portfolio during the month (Friday, Feb. 2) which has already rewarded me with a dividend. If you read my January update, you will know that I had planned on re-balancing because the fixed income funds had dropped well below my targets, and that was mostly caused by the fantastic month January was for equities. Well just as I was preparing to do that (on that next Monday the 5th), the Dow decided to plunge 1,175 points, or 4.6%, in that single day and caused me to take a step back and re-evaluate my desire to adjust my allocations. So I did not make any asset allocation moves, just purchased the lone stock and collected some dividends. Below I will detail them.February DividendsAs I mentioned, February was a new record for my IRA portfolio, as I collected $215 for the month. February PerformanceA bit of a kick in the pants. All of my gains from January were erased in the very next month. ALL of the stocks I held on January 31 were down with the exception of two. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) was basically flat (up 0.3%) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) was up 7.8% for the month after they reported excellent earnings, raised guidance, hiked their dividend, and announced further stock buy-backs. Everyone else was down 1% or more, with four stocks experiencing double digit pull-backs since January 31.Below are the details of the portfolio's performance including the promised new YTD column. Individual StocksBelow is my updated list of stocks as of close of business on February 28th. After this month and the thrashing that Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (OHI) took, their yield is up to almost 10%. And they announced a dividend freeze, which irks me greatly, but then again the yield is almost 10%. So what to do...?Some stocks have come back down to earth after the beating they took in February, like Genuine Parts Company (GPC) and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP). Both were down more than 10% for the month and both look attractive again. I also said I would consider doubling my position in Realty Income Corporation (O) if it dropped below $50, which it has. Lots of interesting things to look at for March.Projected DividendsProjected dividends for the quarter now exceed $450. That is not an error, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) does pay a dividend in both January and March, but do not (or at least historically do not) pay a dividend in December. I think this will be the final number for Q1, as I believe all dividends have been declared.", "author": "Brian Soule", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4153456-sand-shoes-february-update?source=cnbc"}

{"headline": "Andy Slavitt, ex Medicare and Medicaid chief, becoming health investor", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "Andy Slavitt has been called a renegade, a rabble rouser and a policy wonk. Soon, he might be known by a new title: Venture capitalist.  Slavitt made a name for himself as the entrepreneur-turned-Medicare chief who took on Republican lawmakers seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act. When members of Congress declined to hold town halls to educate their constituents about the pros and cons of the health bill, Slavitt showed up instead. On a tour of the country, Slavitt made appearances in towns ranging from Cleveland, Ohio to Reno, Nevada. His answered questions, broke down policies, and urged anyone who attended to write their senator to block the Republican health bill.  While traveling the country, he refined his investment thesis after hearing from everyday Americans about their health woes and anxieties.  \"We need to stop investing in the third Fitbit for the 50-year-old upper-class person and start innovating for people who have common diseases and conditions, but live in communities with low access to care,\" he said.  Slavitt has now returned to his home town right outside Minneapolis, Minnesota, to invest in ideas that will improve the health care system. CNBC caught up with him about his new fund, which is still in the development phase. He declined to share his limited partners or the funding amount at this stage, as he's still in the process of recruiting partners to join him.  He's starting out with a clear population in mind: The oldest and sickest people in America. While running the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid, Slavitt did not lie awake at night worrying whether the prototypical Fitbit or Apple Watch user met their step goals. People with chronic conditions, like diabetes and heart disease, account for 86 percent of America's health care costs.  \"We need to talk about real human problems,\" he said.  His first investment, in an Alphabet spinout called Cityblock, is in the ideal space. Cityblock isn't treating patients yet, but its goal is to help low-income Americans with costly and complex needs access a range of services, including housing and support. Cityblock isn't a purely philanthropic enterprise. The company sees a path to make money by taking on the risk of these populations, and delivering better, more affordable care. The idea is that a company can put forward a proposal to a payor \u2014 like the government or an employer \u2014 describing how it will bring down costs. If it can deliver, the payor shares a portion of the amount saved. Many investors in Silicon Valley don't take on these challenges as they involve working with the federal government, both as a payor and potentially as a regulator.  Instead, wearables, calorie-counting apps, and nutritional supplements have proven more attractive to those who are looking for a quick return. As Slavitt puts it, this is technology that \"chases the wrong problem.\"  And despite what investors think, financial returns from these more popular start-up ideas might also be limited. The government remains the largest single payer of health care in the United States. And if Slavitt has his way, that will not change anytime soon \u2014 he's also running a nonprofit called the United States of Care to promote the idea of universal health care. The one exception to this rule is Medicare, which covers the bulk of insurance costs for people age 65 and over, thanks to a type of health plan called Medicare Advantage or \"Part C\". Under these plans, the government picks up the cost, which gives the private insurers a steady stream of revenue.  The most-capitalized start-ups in the space include Clover Health ($425 million in venture capital), Bright Health ($240 million) and Devoted Health ($62 million).  So Slavitt is putting his attention towards Medicaid, the state and federal program that provides health coverage for low-income Americans, and has received very little attention from Sand Hill Road.  To do that requires a shift in thinking, says Slavitt. The biggest change is that entrepreneurs need to treat health and human services as one thing. Poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, poor nutrition and so on, are deeply correlated with health problems. Sending a patient home with a prescription isn't going to fix the problem.  \"If you can help a hospital take care of a patient in the community, everyone saves money and everyone wins,\" he said.

{"headline": "Does Apple Have An Upgrade Problem? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "SummaryBattery replacement wait times are increasing.JP Morgan lowers iPhone X estimates.Are higher prices the best solution?No matter how positive you are on any company or stock, it's always wise to look at potential risks to the downside. Today, I want to explore this angle for Apple (AAPL), a name I've been very positive on over the years. While I still think that upside remains moving forward, there is one risk for 2018 that does worry me. I'm talking about device upgrades.If we go back to the fiscal Q1 earnings report, Apple reported unit sales in all three main product lines that fell short of expectations. Again, we can throw out year over year growth rates seen as headlines because of the extra week in the prior year period. Despite the unit sales misses, the company was able to still beat overall revenue expectations thanks to much higher than expected average selling prices, primarily on the iPhone. The iPad also saw a nice ASP gain over the prior year period.Everyone knows that Apple charges premium prices for its products. With those prices, however, comes an expectation of high quality. When you are paying $800 or more for a phone, you expect it to last, usually more so than one that only costs a fraction of that price. One Apple analyst recently published the following estimate of an Apple device lifespan, with the figure rising over the past couple of years. (Source: Horace Deidu via MacRumors article)I bring up increasing lifespan estimates because Apple's thought process has somewhat changed in recent times. We don't necessarily see every product refreshed after just one year anymore. Small screen devices such as the iPhone SE and iPad mini are now considered quite outdated, and I'm curious to see if we finally get refreshes this year outside of the minor upgrades to storage space we saw in 2017. At the end of this month, customers who bought the iPhone SE when it first came out will be off their 2-year contracts, so what will they do if Apple doesn't launch a new small screen device?Driving consumers to upgrade faces another hurdle this year, and that's due to the battery issue Apple has detailed for some older generation iPhones. Last week, a Barclays analyst noted that average wait times for a new battery have jumped to a minimum of 2.7 weeks from 2.3 weeks earlier in the year, with a lot of customers complaining about the long wait. This analyst believes that the $29 replacement could cost the company millions of unit sales this year as consumers get a new battery instead of a new phone. Apple CEO Tim Cook says that lost sales weren't even a consideration when they instituted the battery replacement offer, as detailed on the latest conference call:On the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape, or form, what it would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers. And sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have. And again, it\u2019s not -- was not in our thought process of deciding to do what we've done.Are we starting to see some impact of consumer pushback when it comes to iPhone sales? Late last week, an analyst at JP Morgan reduced the firm's iPhone X sales estimate, partially offset by increased sales of lower priced phones. Full year sales are now expected to rise by just 2% to 3% versus the previous forecast for 9% growth. Even when taking into account better than expected selling prices, its hard for iPhone revenues to impress when you take down your unit sales number by more than 10 million for the year. On Monday, another Apple analyst lowered his fiscal 2018 unit sales estimate by 3.7 million units, citing a lack of upgrades in the near-term.Does Apple have an upgrade problem? That's the question I'm asking today, and I look forward to your comments below. Over the next couple of months, I'll be closely watching to see if Apple introduces new versions of its smaller screen devices, otherwise growth estimates may need to come down a little. Fortunately, investors may be a little forgiving at the next earnings report, given Apple is expected to announce an increase to its already massive capital return plan. However, dividends and buybacks won't satisfy everyone for long if too many consumers decide to go with battery replacements instead of buying new iPhones.", "author": "Bill Maurer", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4153308-apple-upgrade-problem?source=cnbc"}
{"headline": "Apple to launch cheaper MacBook Air this year: KGI Securities", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "Apple could launch a cheaper MacBook Air this year, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is known for his accurate insights into the technology firm's future products. The analyst, from KGI Securities, said that a new 13-inch version of Apple's thin laptop could be released in the second quarter of 2018. \"We expect Apple to roll out the new MacBook Air with a lower price tag in 2Q18.

{"headline": "John And Jane - February Dividend Income Tracker - Taxable Account | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "SummaryThis is the 4th month I have officially tracked dividend income and it was the strongest month yet with a total of $1271.50 of dividends received.AT&amp;T, EPR Properties, Mesabi Trust, Realty Income, Simon Property Group, Spectra Energy Partners, TransMontaigne Partners, and Westlake Chemical Partners all increased their dividends payments.A brief overview and discussion of the current state of the stock market.The taxable account has very few changes left to be made but this doesn't mean we set it on auto-pilot and forget it.This article includes all payout updates for February as well as a brief overview of what we are expecting in March.Investment ThesisFebruary marks the fourth month that John and Jane have had a well-established concentration of stocks in their taxable portfolio. A total of eight stocks in the taxable portfolio delivered increased dividend payments during the month of February.As I continue to document John and Jane success my long-term goal is to create a database that allows for year-over-year (YoY) comparisons that demonstrate the power and simplicity of dividend investing. In addition to documenting the past, I also like to forecast the upcoming month of dividends because I believe it helps keep expectations in check.As always, I would like to include a disclaimer that states this article is based on an actual portfolio for clients' of mine. The goal is to build a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, bonds, etc. that will continue to produce a long-lasting income stream with a minimal emphasis on capital appreciation.Dividend and Distribution IncreasesSimilar to in my update from January, John And Jane - January Dividend Income Tracker, another eight stocks in John and Jane's portfolio delivered increased dividends in the month of January. The remainder of the section is used to give a brief overview of the companies and document the total dividend increase:AT&amp;T (T): AT&amp;T kind of feels like an income investor's best friend. I mean, who doesn't like a company that currently pays a yield of 5.5% and has consistently grown their dividend for 33 years straight? The stock has struggled to find its footing as it waits to meet the Department of Justice in court concerning its $85 billion merger with Time Warner (TWX). Personally, I think it's worth the wait because AT&amp;T operates a company that excels in almost any economic environment. Just think about it: How many people in the United States could actually survive without a cell phone? While I don't expect to see capital appreciation anytime soon, I do believe that AT&amp;T offers the kind of consistent dividend income retirees like John and Jane need. With the exception of the legal controversy behind TWX in November, AT&amp;T has found strong support around the $36/share level. T data by YChartsAT&amp;T's dividend was increased from $.49/share per quarter to $.50/share per quarter. This represents a 2% increase YoY and results in a current yield just over 5.5% based on a share price of $36.07.EPR Properties (EPR): After a major Q4-2017 earnings miss EPR has managed to go on sale even more than it already was. Earnings were particularly impacted by one of their tenants, Children's Learning Adventure (CLA). This resulted in EPR writing off $9 million in straight-line revenue which management notes was the conservative approach to resolve the situation. This reduced 2018 funds from operations outlook from a range of $5.33 to $5.48 (original estimates) to a slightly reduced range of $5.23 to $5.38. If improvements in CLA's financial situation occur, management states that it is very possible they could still hit the high end of their original earnings estimates. EPR data by YChartsAs noted in the chart above, EPR has experienced a tough run over the last three months. The small setbacks are barely a concern and I like the potential for continued growth in the TopGolf franchise and Resorts World Catskills Casino and Hotel.EPR's dividend was increased from $.34/share per month to $.36/share per month. This represents a 6% increase YoY and results in a current yield just over 7.5% based on a share price of $53.18.Mesabi Trust (MSB): Trump's proposal of tariffs lit a fire under MSB's share price as it jumped more than 12% on March 1st. MSB derives its income from Peter Mitchell Mine and provides high-grade iron ore to Northshore Mining Corporation and is a subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF).

{"headline": "US security panel deals major blow to Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "A U.S. government panel on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting, an unprecedented move that cast new doubt on Singapore-based Broadcom's $117 billion bid for its U.S. semiconductor peer. The intervention highlights U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security concerns, does not typically review mergers before companies have clinched an agreement. CFIUS asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, that had been scheduled for Tuesday, by 30 days. Reuters had reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom's bid amid growing pressure from politicians, including senior Republican Senator John Cornyn. \"This measure will afford CFIUS the ability to investigate fully Broadcom's proposed acquisition of Qualcomm,\" the U.S. Department of Treasury said in a statement. As the semiconductor industry is locked in a race to develop chips that power so-called 5G wireless technology that allow the transmission of data at faster speeds, San Diego-based Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to Chinese companies vying for market share in the sector, such as Huawei Technologies Co, making it a prized asset. Part of the CFIUS' current concern, which is echoed in a letter Cornyn sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm's 11-member board. Broadcom shares dropped 2.5 percent in morning trading, while Qualcomm fell 0.7 percent. Broadcom said on Monday that CFIUS' intervention was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to seek an investigation into the offer, which Qualcomm's board has said significantly undervalues the company. Before Broadcom disclosed its buyout offer for Qualcomm in November, President Donald Trump himself announced Broadcom's plan to shift its headquarters back to the United States after a White House meeting with Chief Executive Hock Tan. Trump praised the move at the time, calling Broadcom \"one of the really great, great companies.\" Broadcom said on Monday it is run by a board and senior management team consisting almost entirely of Americans and is largely owned by the same U.S. institutional investors that own Qualcomm. \"Broadcom continues to pursue the redomiciliation process as expeditiously as possible,\" Broadcom said. \"Upon completion of the redomiciliation, Broadcoms proposed acquisition of Qualcomm will not be a CFIUS covered transaction.\" Qualcomm, which has told shareholders it is open to the merger at the right price and terms, had said last week it had no intention of delaying the annual shareholder meeting. \"Qualcomm now has their excuse to postpone their critical vote, giving them some breathing room to work on its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV, attempt to make progress on their Apple Inc licensing issues, and attempt to build a stronger case for shareholders,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Qualcomm on Monday extended its $44-billion tender offer for NXP to March 9, as it awaits clearance from China's MOFCOM, the only regulator globally required to approve the deal that has yet to do so. Qualcomm is in a legal battle with Apple over licensing and allegations that it has not delivered on promised rebates - seen by analysts as an effort by Apple to undermine Qualcomm's strong position in mobile chips.", "author": "CNBC", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/05/qualcomm-secretly-asked-a-us-security-panel-to-probe-its-117b-buyout-offer-delaying-its-shareholder-meeting-broadcom-claims.html"}
{"headline": "Deciphering Immersion's 2018 Guidance - Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "AAPL", "text": "SummaryImmersion announced a global settlement with Apple just a couple of days before the ITC initial determination was due. Terms of the agreement are confidential.Immersion\u2019s guidance for 2018 forecasts annual revenues of $80 to $95 million and non-GAAP net income of $35 to $46 million, compared with revenues of $35 million in 2017.Revenue increase forecasted for 2018 excludes any impact from ongoing litigation with Samsung, Fitbit, Motorola. However, it would probably be a mistake to attribute its increment to Apple only.The implementation of new revenue recognition accounting standards will make it harder for investors to follow the story going forward. Expect huge variations in quarterly results.We make an attempt to decipher Immersion\u2019s 2018 guidance and the Apple settlement, reverse engineering some available data. Background On January 29th, Immersion Corporation (IMMR) announced a global settlement with Apple (AAPL) just a few hours before the International Trade Commission initial determination was due. The ITC investigation was scheduled to provide its opinion on January 31. Terms of the Immersion-Apple agreement are confidential, as it usually happens in such situations. However, the settlement is without any doubt a strong endorsement of Immersion\u2019s IP in the mobility space. Immersion\u2019s guidance for 2018 forecasts annual revenues in the $80 to $95 million range and non-GAAP net income of $35 to $46 million, compared with revenues of $35.0 million only in 2017. Both news (the Apple settlement and stronger than expected guidance) drove the increase of Immersion\u2019s shares to the $11 range, from roughly $7. chart from nasdaq.com, with author comments Investors willing to find out more about the financial implications of the Apple settlement or what Immersion\u2019s strong 2018 guidance may mean for the company going forward are left with the interesting task of trying to connect some well hidden dots and play some guessing games. Immersion itself has clearly indicated that it will only disclose some selected data in the next quarterly report, after announcing Q1 2018 results: Charles Anderson OK. Can you be specific on how much is front-end loaded specifically on 2018 and maybe if not on the call is there \u2013 is that something that would be disclosed in the K and 10-Q, just to help us understand how we look at sort of the baseline of the business if that makes sense? Nancy Erba We won't be disclosing that in the K. As part of the Q, we will do the modified retrospective and there will be a little bit more information at that point in time. But as of now and what we disclosed in the K, we will not have that detail. With just very few details available, we\u2019ll start a guessing game, well aware that deciphering the Oracle of Delphi\u2019s prophecies may be, in comparison, a much easier challenge. Readers beware: We wouldn\u2019t be surprised to be proven wrong on some of our assumptions in just a few months. New revenue recognition accounting standards, and how they will impact Immersion A new Revenue Recognition Accounting Standard, ASC 606, to be implemented in 2018, will have a strong impact on Immersion. First, let\u2019s have a look at fixed price and variable per-unit royalties, as reported in 2017: Effective Q1 2018, Immersion\u2019s per-unit royalty revenues will be reported based on company\u2019s estimates of the underlying shipments for the quarter, rather than one quarter in arrears, based on real royalty reports received from customers. In plain English, Q1 will stop being Immersion\u2019s highest quarter due to strong holiday sales in the mobility and gaming sector reported by customers and recorded by Immersion one quarter in arrears, and Q4 will probably substitute Q1 to this purpose, with some adjustments being regularly made each quarter so that \u201cestimates meet real sales.\u201d Immersion does not expect a strong impact to its variable royalty revenue stream, if not on seasonality, from this accounting change. However, as the company transitions to this new accounting system, Q4 2017 customer sales will have to be somehow disclosed. Analyzing Immersion\u2019s recently filed 10-K, we get some additional information about how customers with per-unit contracts performed in Q4 2017: Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, the Company will recognize the per-unit royalty revenue for customer transactions that occur in the fourth quarter of 2017 as an adjustment to accumulated deficit. Based on royalty reports received for the period and the estimates for those not yet received, the Company has estimated the impact on accumulated deficit will be $5.2 million. Variable royalties, for comparison purposes, were $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition related to Immersion\u2019s fixed license fee arrangements will, on the other side, be quite significant. While Immersion will implement a system where, for some contracts, a portion of its fixed license revenues will actually be recognized over the term of the agreement, based on patents to be issued, and expected to be made available to customers during the contract term, our understanding is that a substantial portion (the large majority) of revenues from fixed license fee will have to be reported when the contract is signed, making it harder for analysts and investors to properly forecast, model and understand how the company is performing. Here's how Immersion describes its new accounting approach to fixed license fees contracts in the 10-K: (pg. 53). In connection with the allocation of the transfer price between these two aforementioned performance obligations (patents in existence when the contract is signed and patents to be issued, finalized, or approved over the contract term), the Company has developed a process to estimate the standalone price for each of the two performance obligations in these arrangements, considering a number of factors primarily based on the volume of the Company's patents outstanding as of the contract date as well as those which are expected to be filed and enforceable during the contract term. The \u201cNintendo\u201d conundrum A very interesting question arising from this new accounting standard is: \u201cWhat happens to existing multi-year fixed-fee contracts that were previously being recognized ratably over the term of the contract?\u201d As they are already in place, we speculate their recognition should follow the new rule, and determine a much higher impact on 2018 revenues, compared to the old accounting system. As noticed, Immersion recorded $12.6 million in fixed-fee revenues in 2017, a large decrease from previous years, when Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) alone was paying around $19/$20 million per year. We believe that Nintendo, which signed a multi-year agreement at the beginning of 2017, is a good example falling into this category. In our estimates, Nintendo signed in Q3 2016 a six-year fixed-rate contract worth almost $26 million - see for reference our article \u201cImmersion: Disclosed $25 Million Deferred Revenue Causes A Huge Spike After Q3 Results\u201d (SA Pro). Assuming we are correct in estimating that a large part of these contracts, including Nintendo, will have to be recognized at the very beginning of 2018, and taking into consideration the portion of long-term deferred revenues reported at the end of Q4 2017, the impact to Immersion\u2019s guidance could be quite significant (our crystal ball estimates a number that could reach $20 million, in total for 2018, for fixed-term contracts). Deciphering the Apple settlement - reverse engineering 2018 guidance Terms of the Immersion-Apple agreement are confidential, and all we are aware of is that the settlement includes a multi-year access to IMMR IP. What we know for sure is Immersion\u2019s cost of litigation with Apple, estimated by the company in the $38.7 million range, and incurred between Q4 2016 and Q4 2017. The management shakeup of November 2017 seems to have acted as a catalyst for the decision to find a settlement with Apple ahead of the ITC initial determination, probably a prudent change of strategy given Immersion\u2019s risk of getting very low on cash before a final judgment could have been issued. This new management approach toward \u201csettling\u201d rather than \u201clitigating to the very end\u201d may hopefully lead to relatively quick agreements in the other court cases IMMR is involved in, at the moment. Going back to guidance, here's a chart resuming Immersion\u2019s yearly revenues since 2013, with our estimates for 2018: In our analysis, we\u2019ve tried to break down Immersion\u2019s main drivers of revenues for the past (Samsung, fixed and variable, per-unit royalties), and made predictions for 2018 that include the potential impact of ASC 606 on existing fixed contracts, to find out what Apple may represent in revenues, using Immersion\u2019s mid point of guidance as a reference point. The number we get for Apple is in the $46 million range - a guessing game, as indicated at the begging of our article, with a lot of moving parts due to the lack of proper information and data to better estimate the real number. If we speculate that the settlement has a three-year length, with renewal options, and that the portion recorded in 2018 represents roughly three-fourths of its total value, we get a similar figure to what Samsung was paying each year previously ($20 million annually). Samsung, Fitbit and Motorola as catalysts to future share price appreciations Immersion is expecting to spend about $8 to $10 million in legal fees related to litigation with Samsung, Fitbit (FIT) and Motorola (now part of Lenovo) (OTCPK:LNVGY). The company\u2019s very strong cash position, after settling with Apple, should allow management to continue if necessary their litigation strategy or pursue the best settlement possible with each of these parties, especially now that Immersion\u2019s IP has further been validated by a key customer like Apple. While Fitbit\u2019s and Motorola\u2019s contribution to revenues should be relatively modest (but could still represent a few million a year, combined), Samsung could really move the needle if Immersion is capable to negotiate an agreement at least in line with the previous one (roughly $20 million on a yearly basis). Given Immersion\u2019s business model, most revenues coming from new agreements would fall directly to the bottom line. Conclusion The Apple settlement represents a much needed inflection point for the company. While difficult to analyze in full detail, beyond representing a strong endorsement of Immersion\u2019s IP in the mobility space, it has, in our view, a material impact on the company\u2019s financials, and may act as a positive catalyst for other customers, in the mobility vertical, to license Immersion\u2019s IP. If we read the tea leaves properly, after going \u201call inn\u201d in court, Immersion\u2019s management now seems inclined to proceed with a more prudent approach both to handling litigation and OpEx. The unpredictability on the timing of new settlements/agreements and the difficulty to model future revenues may distract investors, in the short term, from the reality of a company that seems to have turned the corner in mobility and may be close also to reaping some rewards in the automobile sector, that increased 28% in 2017.

{"headline": "A cheaper MacBook Air makes perfect sense", "tick": "AAPL", "text": " A recent KGI Securities note said Apple is planning to launch a cheaper 13-inch MacBook Air during the second quarter of this year. It makes perfect sense for Apple to make this move, and I'd buy one in a heartbeat. Apple currently only offers a $999 MacBook Air that, despite upgrades to its processor, hasn't changed drastically in years. It still has the same low-resolution display, for example. Apple's next most affordable MacBook is the $1,299 model, which has a sharper but smaller 12-inch display, only has a single USB-C port and is a bit more cramped to use. There's a market for a more affordable MacBook Air, including me. Last year, for example, I purchased the $1,299 MacBook but found that it was too tiny for me to use comfortably for work, even though I loved the compact size for travel. I ended up returning it and buying a Lenovo laptop with a 4K touch screen, several USB ports, an SD card slot and larger display for the same price. I would have purchased a MacBook Air, but I felt that $999 was too much compared with similar notebooks running Windows 10. If Apple launches a notebook somewhere in the $799 to $999 range, maybe keeps some of the legacy hardware including the SD slot and additional USB ports that are still found on the current MacBook Air, I'd be all in. Plus, with dozens of new Windows laptops that are premium and still cost under $1,000, Apple is losing out on potential customers who want to save money but still want a high-end product. Apple used to offer an affordable option with its 11.6-inch MacBook Air, but it killed that off in 2016. Apple could increase MacBook sales volume, too, if it plays its cards right. \"In the PC world, particularly notebooks, there is a direct relationship between price and volume,\" Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, told CNBC. \"If Apple wanted to sell more MacBooks they could do that easily by having a $799 price point.\" The problem is Apple hasn't historically made products for the low-end market, Moorhead said. Plus, while the iPad Pro 10.5 works for some folks as a full-fledged work machine, it's still not powerful enough for me to get any real work done. A cheaper MacBook Air could be the sweet spot Apple needs.", "author": "Todd Haselton", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/05/a-cheaper-macbook-air-makes-perfect-sense.html"}
