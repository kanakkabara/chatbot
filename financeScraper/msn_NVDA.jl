GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were a record $1.78, up 80 percent from $0.99 a year ago and up 34 percent from $1.33 in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.72, also a record, up 52 percent from $1.13 a year earlier and up 29 percent from $1.33 in the previous quarter.  For fiscal 2018, revenue was a record $9.71 billion, up 41 percent from $6.91 billion a year earlier. GAAP earnings per diluted share were a record $4.82, up 88 percent from $2.57 a year earlier. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $4.92, also a record, up 61 percent from $3.06 a year earlier.  \u201cWe achieved another record quarter, capping an excellent year,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. \u201cIn a powerful sign of our progress, attendees at NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conferences reached 22,000, up tenfold in five years, as software developers working in AI, self-driving cars, and a broad range of other fields continued to discover the acceleration and money-saving benefits of our GPU computing platform. \u201cIndustries around the world are racing to incorporate AI. Virtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs. Hundreds of transportation companies are using our NVIDIA DRIVE platform. From manufacturing and healthcare to smart cities, innovators are using our platform to invent the future,\u201d he said. Capital ReturnDuring fiscal 2018, NVIDIA returned $1.25 billion to shareholders through a combination of $909 million in share repurchases and $341 million in quarterly cash dividends.  For fiscal 2019, NVIDIA intends to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on March 16, 2018, to all shareholders of record on February 23, 2018. Q4 Fiscal 2018 Summary  Fiscal 2018 Summary  NVIDIA\u2019s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is as follows:  Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights During the fourth quarter, NVIDIA achieved progress in these areas:   Datacenter  Gaming  Automotive  CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at http://investor.nvidia.com/.  Conference Call and Webcast Information  NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). To listen to the conference call, dial (877) 223-3864 in the United States or (574) 990-1377 internationally, and provide the following conference ID: 6265639. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com, and at www.streetevents.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP Measures  To supplement NVIDIA\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, debt-related costs, the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable, and the provisional tax benefit from income tax reform. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company\u2019s Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

{"headline": "Nvidia Corporation Vs. Cisco Systems, Inc.: Coming Prices As Now Seen By Market Makers - NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "SummaryHas the market disruption shifted price prospects for these specific stocks?Are they still positioned where they were in their industry groups?Have we seen a major re-evaluation of the market?Should you consider a change in your investment strategy? First things first: what about emphasis on Nvidia vs. Cisco?We\u2019ll get to some of the broader strategic questions above later in separate articles. For now, the focus is on portfolio wealth-building choices between Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO).Our perspective, as usual, draws on the actions of the Market-Making community [MMs] as they seek to provide transaction liquidity for major institutional-investor funds typically managing billion-dollar equity portfolios. Particularly in times like these their desires to make volume adjustments to their holdings takes on an additional sense of urgency.In ordinary times, their size precludes participating in ordinary \u201cregular-way\u201d auction markets. They live in a \u201cdeal\u201d world where \u201cother side\u201d of their desired trade gets lined up by the MMs in private negotiations with other like-sized players so the entire \u201cblock\u201d trade gets executed at one price, at one time, for all participants.Usually a \u201ccross\u201d of instantly-balanced sellers and buyers is not available. So, the MM faced with the big-bucks trade order may stop being just a sales agent, and become a principal by \u201cfilling\u201d the imbalance and thus putting their own MM firm capital at risk of unwanted market price moves. That will only happen (and most often does) when a separate hedging deal in separate derivatives markets transfers that risk to other willing speculators. Those often are proprietary-trade desks of other MM firms.The cost of that equity-market liquidity is borne by the trade-initiating institution, a part of the spread between what was initially sought as a transaction price, and what can actually be done of the moment. Their acceptance acknowledges the reality of what has been negotiated (but not yet closed) between the MM buyer and the prop-trade seller of the price insurance.Once the block trade is consummated, its price is posted on the public \u201cregular way\u201d markets to maintain transaction transparency. For stocks and ETFs thus involved, it is the \u201cdeal\u201d markets run by the investors with the money muscle that lead the price parade, and the public investors simply follow along.The hedge price-change insurance deal\u2019s terms define the extremes of prices likely to occur during the lives of the derivatives contracts involved. In turn, prior experience with earlier, similarly proportioned forecasts provide a present perspective on what may be coming for prices in next near-term (3-6 months) markets.Here in Figure 1 is what those forecasts for CSCO have been showing, daily, during the past 6 months. All materials presented here have been approved by blockdesk.com.Figure 1 Note: This is not a conventional price history \u201cchart\u201d. It is a record of MM live-date forecasts of the stock\u2019s near-term (3-4 coming months) range of likely prices. Forecasts made on the dates indicated, not after the fact. The vertical price-range forecast lines of Figure 1 are split into upside and downside prospects by the heavy-dot end-of-day market quote for the issue on the day of the forecast.A measure of the imbalance between up and down possible price change implications is the Range Index [RI], which tells what percentage proportion of the entire forecast range lies below the current price. The thumbnail picture at the bottom of Figure 1 presents the distribution of RIs for the stock seen in the past 5 years.CSCO\u2019s current RI of 45 is on the high side of its central narrow set of forecast experiences, suggesting that for the stock to look more attractive in comparison to its own history, it would only take slightly lower RI values in the upper- to mid-30s. They could occur either from continued expectations of rising price ranges while the price stood still, or from price pullbacks not followed by expectations of coming price ranges.", "author": "Peter F.

{"headline": "Frenzied demand for Nvidia's graphic chips shoot prices through the roof", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp's graphic processors, or GPUs, are so overwhelmingly popular that gamers and cryptocurrency miners are willing to pay up to three times the original list price to get their hands on its cards online. The company's GeForce 1070 chip set, which retailed at $349 a year ago, was going for up to $900 from electronics wholesalers on Amazon.com Inc Friday, and the same demand stood behind a stellar set of corporate results on Thursday. The company's share price rose 6 percent in early trading on Friday after at least 14 Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock - a measure of the confidence around the stock among sector analysts. Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia's high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin. The company's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners. \"We do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results. Analysts also say Nvidia's competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year. The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia's revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue. The company's quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba, Amazon , Alphabet, IBM and Microsoft adopted the new chip in their servers. Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption. One pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter. Auto revenue was down as auto infotainment was becoming commoditized and the company is going through a revenue transition phase to ramping its autonomous driving platforms in volume likely in 2019, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said.

{"headline": "AMD Gains Market Share From Intel And Nvidia - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "SummaryMercury Research data points to increased market share for AMD.The company is making inroads on the CPU side against Intel and on the GPU side against Nvidia.This trend seems likely to continue as AMD continues to aggressively price its competitive product offerings. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) investors got some welcome news Monday as the latest data from research firm Mercury Research showed AMD making significant headway against the competition in terms of market share and unit share in Q4 2017. The findings are further confirmation that AMD's product offerings are gaining market share and re-establishing firm footholds in both the CPU market against Intel (INTC) and the GPU market against Nvidia (NVDA). Graphics The juiciest piece of news was that Mercury estimates AMD gained a substantial 6.3% QoQ in market share from Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is a pretty spectacular feat and is yet another sign that Nvidia does not have as dominant a hold on the market as some might have expected. Personally, I expected some reasonable inroads to be made, but 6.3% in a single quarter is truly impressive. There is, of course, still a massive gap between the companies, but I think AMD shareholders have to be happy with these results. The strong graphics performance was likely due to massive demand for Vega primarily from miners and secondarily from gamers for any cards the miners didn't get to. The current cryptocurrency boom has left the GPU market starved for supply to the extent that pretty much all cards are selling well above MSRP, Vega included. However, the market data seems to show that, even in these tricky market conditions, AMD has managed to expand its footprint. All said, Q4 ended with AMD at 33.7% market share and Nvidia at 66.3% compared to 27.2% and 72.8% at the end of Q3, a sizable jump for the former. It also should be noted that the same research that found AMD gaining significant market share in Q4 also estimated that AMD has been the primary beneficiary of cryptocurrency-derived GPU sales. Some might suggest, perhaps with some merit, that the company's newfound market share gains could be built on the back of an ephemeral source of demand should cryptocurrencies decline in price. That discussion is out of the scope of this article, and I will likely look at that topic more in-depth in a separate piece, but, for now, I think it's important that investors now see some of the caveats with this news. As it stands, AMD took a significant chunk of market share from Nvidia in Q4 due to strong demand for Vega. With the GPU market likely to be supply starved for the foreseeable future, I don't think AMD has to worry about their market share gains evaporating any time soon, especially with a 12nm Vega (produced on GlobalFoundries' 12nm LP process) refresh expected to release soon. Again, in the current market environment, I expect those cards to be in a continuous state of \"sold out\" no matter how well they stack up against any comparable Nvidia offerings. Bottom line, AMD made impressive progressive against Nvidia in Q4, boosting its market share to about one-third and proving that Nvidia's dominance is not unassailable. x86 Processors AMD also made solid, if not as drastic, progress in taking market share from Intel in the CPU market. In the desktop CPU market, AMD increased its market share by 2.1% YoY due to Ryzen's attractive price/performance for consumers of all budgets. AMD also increased its server market share by 0.5% YoY in Q4, though, as the company noted somewhat hilariously, that 0.5% increase represents a doubling of AMD's total server market share. While EPYC might not be firing on all cylinders yet, I think AMD's server CPU offerings will only become more competitive as time goes on. Here's Wells Fargo analyst David Wong on his projections for EPYC: We think that AMD could achieve a 5% server processor unit share and perhaps a 3% server processor revenue by the December 2018 quarter. Should AMD successfully bring out its 7nm Zen 2 EPYC server family on time and if this product has competitive performance, we think that AMD\u2019s server processor market share could rise to as much as 10% unit share and 6% revenue share by the December 2019 quarter. From what we've heard about AMD's various partnerships for EPYC, these numbers seem achievable for the first generation of the server chips. Further, I discussed in a previous article that Intel is struggling to figure out its 10nm process while other fabs already are closing on production for 7nm chips (read that piece here), which could set up second-generation EPYC, likely on a 7nm process, to take even more market share than expected. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann weighed in on the Mercury Research data as well, estimating that AMD's total compute market share in Q4 was 3.8%, up from 3.3% in Q3. He added: The share move is not a blip in inventories or some random event,\u201d writes Mosemann, \u201cit is the start of sustained x86 cycle that points to AMD capturing share for the next several years consistent, if not superior, with the 2003-2006 cycle culminating in ~25% unit share. 25% unit share certainly sounds like a bold prediction, but, in my opinion, to achieve this goal AMD just has to execute on its roadmap and continue to stay aggressive on price. The company doesn't have to do anything special for the market to once again start taking AMD products seriously. By remaining consistent and by offering an unbeatable value proposition, as AMD has always done, market share and unit share will come in time. Such is the benefit of having very little market share to lose and a lot to gain. Investor Takeaway AMD is making headway in the CPU and GPU markets at the expense of Intel and Nvidia. The company's impressive share gains in Q4 and an exciting lineup of upcoming products that includes 12nm Vega, 12nm Zen (Zen+), EPYC 7nm (EPYC 2), Zen 7nm (Zen 2), Vega 7nm, and more, position AMD as an attractive stock to own for the short term and long term. With market share gains, AMD has demonstrated the willingness and ability to take on the two behemoths that dominate each of the company's primary markets. There's much more work to be done, but current progress is looking very impressive. Best of luck!

The TPUs are designed specifically for AI and machine learning workloads and provide two main benefits to Google. First, by using its own silicon, Google has a cheaper, more efficient alternative to relying on chipmakers like Nvidia and Intel for its core computing infrastructure. Owning its own hardware enables Google to experiment faster.    The new TPUs also allow parent company Alphabet to add a revenue stream to the Google Cloud Platform.

{"headline": "Why AMD Took Market Share In Graphics Chips From Nvidia - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "SummaryAMD increased its overall graphics chips market share by 8% quarter over quarter. Nvidia suffered a -6% decline quarter over quarter.On discrete GPUs, AMD also posted a notable quarter over quarter increase from 27.2% in Q3 2017 to 33.7% in Q4. Nvidia\u2019s share dipped from 72.8% to 66.3%.Jon Peddie Research also pointed out that AMD was the primary beneficiary of the 3 million discrete GPUs, worth $776 million, sold to cryptocurrency miners in Q4 2017. We knew that higher average selling prices of GPUs helped Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) post a 60% year-over-year Q4 2017 sales performance ($600 million to $958 million) from its Computing and Graphics segment. We should now appreciate that Jon Peddie Research\u2019s Q4 global add-in board report confirmed AMD notably increased its market share in discrete GPUs and in overall graphics chip shipments. AMD took sizeable market share from its GPU rival Nvidia (NVDA) in Q4 2017. AMD increased its quarterly graphics chip shipments in Q4 by 8.1% quarter over quarter. Intel\u2019s (INTC) market share decreased by -2% and Nvidia by -6%. The growing graphics chip business obviously helped AMD offset the -37% Q/Q in revenue from its Enterprise, Semi-custom and Embedded business segment. (Source: Jon Peddie Research) On the more important discrete GPUs or add-in board category, Jon Peddie Research stated that AMD was the primary beneficiary of the 3 million GPUs (worth $776 million) sold to cryptocurrency miners in Q4 2017. We could therefore conclude that cryptocurrency miners greatly contributed to the $958 million fourth quarter revenue of AMD\u2019s Computer and Graphics division. AMD\u2019s 33.7% global in Q4 discrete GPU shipments is notably higher than Q4 2016\u2019s 29.5% and Q3 2017\u2019s 27.2%. AMD\u2019s gain last quarter was Nvidia\u2019s loss. Nvidia saw its discrete GPU share decline from 72.8% to 66.3% in Q4. (Source: Jon Peddie Research) Why AMD Gained Market Share This turn of events can be partly explained by Nvidia\u2019s January 2018 recommendation for retailers to put players above cryptocurrency miners. The insatiable demand for GPUs from Ethereum miners pushed Nvidia\u2019s Pascal GPUs to sell well above their suggested retail prices. The scarcity and ultra-high retail prices of Nvidia\u2019s GTX 1070/1080 GPU will continuously compel cryptocurrency miners and gamers to just buy Radeon Vega and Polaris GPUs. It also helps AMD that the old Polaris graphics cards are still excellent for Ethereum-mining purposes. AMD is likely to remain the primary beneficiary of the cryptocurrency mining this year because it offers more affordable Ethereum-friendly GPUs. I was forced to use RX 470 GPUs for my solar power-based Ethereum mining rig last year because it was impossible to find reasonably-priced Nvidia\u2019s GTX 1070 products here in the Philippines. (Source: Cryptos R Us) My Takeaway Ethereum is considered as more stable/resilient than Bitcoin. AMD will therefore continue to benefit from the high price of Ether. Nvidia reportedly expects discrete GPU prices to skyrocket until Q3 2018. Ether\u2019s price still hovers above $850. Last year it was trading for less than $15. Like what happened in 2017, gamers will endure intense competition for available discrete video cards from Ethereum miners this year. Ether\u2019s high market value is very addictive. (Source I'm expecting AMD\u2019s Computing and Graphics segment to again post a double-digit year-over-year growth in Q1 to Q3 2018. The Q1 2017 revenue of Computing and Graphics was $593 million. I expect Computing and Graphics to again achieve $900 million-plus this Q1 2018. Aside from cryptocurrency miners\u2019 insatiable appetite for GPUs, Intel is now also buying Radeon M Vega GPUs for its 8th-gen Core x86 processors. Lastly, AMD\u2019s launch of two budget Ryzen APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) with Vega graphics could boost its market share against Nvidia this quarter. I expect Jon Peddie Research to report AMD posting quarter-over-growth in overall graphics chip shipments for Q1 2018. The cost savings from buying $169 Ryzen 6 2500G and $99 Ryzen 3 2200G APUs could attract the attention of PC manufacturers and casual PC gamers. (Source: AMD) Based on the tests of PC Perspective, the AMD Ryzen 5 2400G handily outperformed Intel\u2019s $179 Core i5-8400 (uses the UHD 630 GPU) on GPGPU (general purpose GPU) benchmark scores.

{"headline": "Secretive Chinese bitcoin mining company may have made as much money as Nvidia last year", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "A secretive Chinese start-up called Bitmain that dominates the bitcoin \"mining\" industry likely made as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, Bernstein analysts estimate. Based on conservative estimates of gross margin of 75 percent and operating margin of 65 percent, the analysts calculate that Bitmain made $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017. Bernstein's U.S. semiconductor team estimates Nvidia's operation profit was $3 billion during the same period. \"But Bitmain achieved this in merely four years, while it took Nvidia 24 years to get here,\" the Bernstein analysts said in a report published Wednesday.  Beijing-based Bitmain was founded by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan in 2013. The company has since grown into one of the primary firms involved with bitcoin mining, the process of using computing power to generate bitcoins. Wu is also a widely followed figure in the bitcoin world.  Bitmain declined to comment for this story. Bitmain generates its revenue from several parts (highlighted in gray) of the bitcoin mining supply chain  Source: Bernstein In the early days of bitcoin, enthusiasts could use ordinary video graphics cards to profitably process computations needed to mine the cryptocurrency. But a Chinese-based company turned bitcoin mining into a specialized process in 2013 by selling application-specific integrated circuits, or asic, computer chip cards that could mine bitcoin 50 times faster than traditional video graphics cards. Today, Bitmain sells Antminer bitcoin mining rigs that can cost several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars each. The company also operates \"mining pools\" in which participants collaborate on bitcoin mining in order to cut costs. As a result, Bernstein estimates Bitmain has 70 to 80 percent of market share in bitcoin miners and asics.  The analysts estimate that most of Bitmain's revenue was generated by selling miners powered by the company's chips. \"The rest was largely generated by mining itself and, to a much lesser extent, by collecting management fees from the mining pools it operates and renting out the mining power of its mining farms through cloud services.\"  Much of the growth in mining revenue came from the exponential rise in bitcoin prices, the Bernstein report said. Its analysis also indicated that \"Bitmain shrewdly adjusts the prices of miners according to bitcoin prices.\" Bitcoin price and miner price  Source: Amazon.com, camelcamelcamel.com and Bernstein estimates and analysis So as bitcoin skyrocketed toward $20,000 late last year, the price of Bitmain's AntMiner S9 climbed near $5,000 while production costs remained the same, according to Bernstein's estimates. To come to the final $3 billion to $4 billion operating profit figure, the Bernstein analysts also looked at Bitmain's purchases from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and estimated the start-up contributed 2 to 3 percent of the chipmaker's total revenue last year. \"In the year 2018, Bitmain will likely lead the cryptocurrency asic industry and migrate some of its chips to 10nm and the most advanced 7nm,\" the report said. \"That will make the company one of the top five users of TSMC's 7nm in 2018, with demand comparable with Qualcomm's, HiSilicon's, or AMD's.\"  Source: Bernstein estimates and analysis But longer-term growth is not guaranteed, especially in the fickle cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin has lost half its value in about two months amid worries about a regulatory crackdown. Chinese authorities have taken some of the strongest actions so far by banning initial coin offerings and causing local bitcoin exchanges to close. Bitmain has taken strategic steps to stay ahead of the game. The company launched a mining pool subsidiary last April in Israel, and is opening mining farms in Canada and Switzerland, and regional headquarters in Singapore, the Bernstein report pointed out. Bitmain is also expanding its business to other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and monero. The Bernstein analysts say the Chinese company also has a \"massive cash position\" that should help it through sluggish periods in the industry. And in its main bitcoin mining business, Bitmain protects itself from losing too much to investor speculation by selling chips to miners, rather than doing all the bitcoin mining itself.  \"Some money is left with customers, but so are a lot of risks,\" the report said. \"The results, in our view, have been remarkable.\"", "author": "Evelyn Cheng", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/secretive-chinese-bitcoin-mining-company-may-have-made-as-much-money-as-nvidia-last-year.html"}
{"headline": "AMD's Growing CPU Advantage Over Intel - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "SummaryAMD's past and economic hazards.AMD's Current market conditions.AMD Zen CPU advantage over Intel. AMD is primarily a CPU fabrication company with much experience and a great history in that respect. They hold patents for 64-bit processing, as well as ARM based processing patents, and GPU architecture patents. AMD built a name for itself in the mid-to-late 90\u2019s when they introduced the K-series CPU\u2019s to good reviews followed by the Athlon series in \u201899. AMD was profitable, they bought the companies NexGen, Alchemy Semiconductor, and ATI. Past Economic Hazards If AMD has such a great history, then what happened? Before I go over the technical advantage that AMD has over Intel, it\u2019s worth looking to see how AMD failed in the past, and to see if those hazards still present a risk to AMD. As for investment purposes we\u2019re more interested in AMD\u2019s turning a profit. AMD suffered from intermittent CPU fabrication problems, and was also the victim of sustained anti-competitive behaviour from Intel who interfered with AMD\u2019s attempts to sell its CPU\u2019s to the market through Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba, Fujitsu, NEC, Dell, Gateway, HP, Acer, and Lenovo. Intel was investigated and/or fined by multiple countries including Japan, Korea, USA, and EU. These hazard needs to be examined to see if history will repeat itself. There have been some rather large changes in the market since then. 1) The EU has shown they are not averse to leveling large fines, and Intel is still fighting the guilty verdict from the last EU fine levied against them; they\u2019ve already lost one appeal. It\u2019s conceivable to expect that the EU, and other countries, would prosecute Intel again. This is compounded by the recent security problems with Intel CPU\u2019s and the fact that Intel sold these CPU\u2019s under false advertising as secure when Intel knew they were not. Here are some of the largest fines dished out by the EU 2) The Internet has evolved from Web 1.0 to 2.0. Consumers are increasing their online presence each year. This reduces the clout that Intel can wield over the market as AMD can more easily sell to consumers through smaller Internet based companies. 3) Traditional distributors (HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc.) are struggling. All of these companies have had recent issues with declining revenue due to Internet competition, and ARM competition. These companies are struggling for sales and this reduces the clout that Intel has over them, as Intel is no longer able to ensure their future. It no longer pays to be in the club. These points are summarized in the graph below, from Statista, which shows \u201cODM Direct\u201d sales and \u201cother sales\u201d increasing their market share from 2009 to Q3 2017. 4) AMD spun off Global Foundries as a separate company. AMD has a fabrication agreement with Global Foundries, but is also free to fabricate at another foundry such as TSMC, where AMD has recently announced they will be printing Vega at 7nm. 5) Global Foundries developed the capability to fabricate at 16nm, 14nm, and 12nm alongside Samsung, and IBM, and bought the process from IBM to fabricate at 7nm. These three companies have been cooperating to develop new fabrication nodes. 6) The computer market has grown much larger since the mid-90\u2019s \u2013 2006 when AMD last had a significant tangible advantage over Intel, as computer sales rose steadily until 2011 before starting a slow decline, see Statista graph below. The decline corresponds directly to the loss of competition in the marketplace between AMD and Intel, when AMD released the Bulldozer CPU in 2011. Tablets also became available starting in 2010 and contributed to the fall in computer sales which started falling in 2012. It\u2019s important to note that computer shipments did not fall in 2017, they remained static, and AMD\u2019s GPU market share rose in Q4 2017 at the expense of Nvidia and Intel. 7) In terms of fabrication, AMD has access to 7nm on Global Foundries as well as through TSMC. It\u2019s unlikely that AMD will experience CPU fabrication problems in the future. This is something of a reversal of fortunes as Intel is now experiencing issues with its 10nm fabrication facilities which are behind schedule by more than 2 years, and maybe longer. It would be costly for Intel to use another foundry to print their CPU\u2019s due to the overhead that their current foundries have on their bottom line. If Intel is unable to get the 10nm process working, they\u2019re going to have difficulty competing with AMD. AMD: Current market conditions In 2011 AMD released its Bulldozer line of CPU\u2019s to poor reviews and was relegated to selling on the discount market where sales margins are low. Since that time AMD\u2019s profits have been largely determined by the performance of its GPU and Semi-Custom business. Analysts have become accustomed to looking at AMD\u2019s revenue from a GPU perspective, which isn\u2019t currently being seen in a positive light due to the relation between AMD GPU\u2019s and cryptocurrency mining. The market views cryptocurrency as further risk to AMD. When Bitcoin was introduced it was also mined with GPU\u2019s. When the currency switched to ASIC circuits (a basic inexpensive and simple circuit) for increased profitability (ASIC\u2019s are cheaper because they\u2019re simple), the GPU\u2019s purchased for mining were resold on the market and ended up competing with and hurting new AMD GPU sales. There is also perceived risk to AMD from Nvidia which has favorable reviews for its Pascal GPU offerings. While AMD has been selling GPU\u2019s they haven\u2019t increased GPU supply due to cryptocurrency demand, while Nvidia has. This resulted in a very high cost for AMD GPU\u2019s relative to Nvidia\u2019s. There are strategic reasons for AMD\u2019s current position: 1) While the AMD GPU\u2019s are profitable and greatly desired for cryptocurrency mining, AMD\u2019s market access is through 3rd party resellers whom enjoy the revenue from marked-up GPU sales. AMD most likely makes lower margins on GPU sales relative to the Zen CPU sales due to higher fabrication costs associated with the fabrication of larger size dies and the corresponding lower yield. For reference I\u2019ve included the size of AMD\u2019s and Nvidia\u2019s GPU\u2019s as well as AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPU and Intel\u2019s Coffee lake 8th generation CPU. This suggests that if AMD had to pick and choose between products, they\u2019d focus on Zen due higher yield and revenue from sales and an increase in margin. 2) If AMD maintained historical levels of GPU production in the face of cryptocurrency demand, while increasing production for Zen products, they would maximize potential income for highest margin products (EPYC), while reducing future vulnerability to second-hand GPU sales being resold on the market. 3) AMD was burned in the past from second hand GPU\u2019s and want to avoid repeating that experience. AMD stated several times that the cryptocurrency boom was not factored into forward looking statements, meaning they haven\u2019t produced more GPU\u2019s to expect more GPU sales. In contrast, Nvidia increased its production of GPU\u2019s due to cryptocurrency demand, as AMD did in the past. Since their Pascal GPU has entered its 2nd year on the market and is capable of running video games for years to come (1080p and 4k gaming), Nvidia will be entering a position where they will be competing directly with older GPU\u2019s used for mining, that are as capable as the cards Nvidia is currently selling. Second-hand GPU\u2019s from mining are known to function very well, with only a need to replace the fan. This is because semiconductors work best in a steady state, as opposed to being turned on and off, so it will endure less wear when used 24/7. The market is also pessimistic regarding AMD\u2019s P/E ratio. The market is accustomed to evaluating stocks using the P/E ratio. This statistical test is not actually accurate in evaluating new companies, or companies going into or coming out of bankruptcy. It is more accurate in evaluating companies that have a consistent business operating trend over time. \u201cSimilarly, a company with very low earnings now may command a very high P/E ratio even though it isn\u2019t necessarily overvalued. The company may have just IPO\u2019d and growth expectations are very high, or expectations remain high since the company dominates the technology in its space.\u201d P/E Ratio: Problems With The P/E I regard the pessimism surrounding AMD stock due to GPU\u2019s and past history as a positive trait, because the threat is minor. While AMD is experiencing competitive problems with its GPU\u2019s in gaming AMD holds an advantage in Blockchain processing which stands to be a larger and more lucrative market. I also believe that AMD\u2019s progress with Zen, particularly with EPYC and the recent Meltdown related security and performance issues with all Intel CPU offerings far outweigh any GPU turbulence. This turns the pessimism surrounding AMD regarding its GPU\u2019s into a stock benefit. 1) A pessimistic group prevents the stock from becoming a bubble. -It provides a counter argument against hype relating to product launches that are not proven by earnings. Which is unfortunately a historical trend for AMD as they have had difficulty selling server CPU\u2019s, and consumer CPU\u2019s in the past due to market interference by Intel. 2) It creates predictable daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly fluctuations in the stock price that can be used, to generate income. 3) Due to recent product launches and market conditions (Zen architecture advantage, 12nm node launching, Meltdown performance flaw affecting all Intel CPU\u2019s, Intel\u2019s problems with 10nm) and the fact that AMD is once again selling a competitive product, AMD is making more money each quarter. Therefore the base price of AMD\u2019s stock will rise with earnings, as we\u2019re seeing. This is also a form of investment security, where perceived losses are returned over time, due to a stock that is in a long-term upward trajectory due to new products reaching a responsive market. 4) AMD remains a cheap stock. While it\u2019s volatile it\u2019s stuck in a long-term upward trend due to market conditions and new product launches. An investor can buy more stock (with a limited budget) to maximize earnings. This is advantage also means that the stock is more easily manipulated, as seen during the Q3 2017 ER. 5) The pessimism is unfounded. The cryptocurrency craze hasn\u2019t died, it increased \u2013 fell \u2013 and recovered. The second hand market did not see an influx of mining GPU\u2019s as mining remains profitable. 6) Blockchain is an emerging market, that will eclipse the gaming market in size due to the wide breath of applications across various industries. Vega is a highly desired product for Blockchain applications as AMD has retained a processing and performance advantage over Nvidia. There are more and rapidly growing applications for Blockchain every day, all (or most) of which will require GPU\u2019s. For instance Microsoft, The Golem supercomputer, IBM, HP, Oracle, Red Hat, and others. Long-term upwards trend AMD is at the beginning of a long-term upward trend supported by a comprehensive and competitive product portfolio that is still being delivered to the market, AMD referred to this as product ramping. AMD\u2019s most effective products with Zen is EPYC, and the Raven Ridge APU. EPYC entered the market in mid-December and was completely sold out by mid-January, but has since been restocked. Intel remains uncompetitive in that industry as their CPU offerings are retarded by a 40% performance flaw due to Meltdown patches. Server CPU sales command the highest margins for both Intel and AMD. The AMD Raven Ridge APU was recently released to excellent reviews. The APU is significant due to high GPU prices driven buy cryptocurrency, and the fact that the APU is a CPU/GPU hybrid which has the performance to play games available today at 1080p. The APU also supports the Vulcan API, which can call upon multiple GPU\u2019s to increase performance, so a system can be upgraded with an AMD or Nvidia GPU that supports Vulcan API at a later date for increased performance for those games or workloads that been programmed to support it. Or the APU can be replaced when the prices of GPU\u2019s fall. AMD also stands to benefit as Intel confirmed that their new 10 nm fabrication node is behind in technical capability relative to the Samsung, TSMC, and Global Foundries 7 nm fabrication process. This brings into questions Intel\u2019s competitiveness in 2019 and beyond. Take-Away AMD was uncompetitive with respect to CPU\u2019s from 2011 to 2017 When AMD was competitive, from 1996 to 2011 they did record profit and bought 3 companies including ATI. AMD CPU business suffered from: Market manipulation from Intel. Intel fined by EU, Japan, Korea, and settled with the USA Foundry productivity and upgrade complications AMD has changed Global Foundries spun off as an independent business Has developed 14nm &amp;12nm, and is implementing 7nm fabrication Intel late on 10nm, is less competitive than 7nm node AMD to fabricate products using multiple foundries (TSMC, Global Foundries) The market has changed More AMD products are available on the Internet and both the adoption of the Internet and the size of the Internet retail market has exploded, thanks to the success of smartphones and tablets. Consumer habits have changed, more people shop online each year. Traditional retailers have lost market share. Computer market is larger (on-average), but has been declining. While Computer shipments declined in Q2 and Q3 2017, AMD sold more CPU\u2019s. AMD was uncompetitive with respect to CPU\u2019s from 2011 to 2017. Analysts look to GPU and Semi-Custom sales for revenue. Cryptocurrency boom intensified, no crash occurred. AMD did not increase GPU production to meet cryptocurrency demand. Blockchain represents a new growth potential for AMD GPU\u2019s. Pessimism acts as security against a stock bubble &amp; corresponding bust. Creates cyclical volatility in the stock that can be used to generate profit. P/E ratio is misleading when used to evaluate AMD. AMD has long-term growth potential. 2017 AMD releases competitive product portfolio. Since Zen was released in March 2017 AMD has beat ER expectations. AMD returns to profitability in 2017. AMD taking measureable market share from Intel in OEM CPU Desktop and in CPU market. High margin server product EPYC released in December 2017 before worst ever CPU security bug found in Intel CPU\u2019s that are hit with detrimental 40% performance patch. Ryzen APU (Raven Ridge) announced in February 2018, to meet gaming GPU shortage created by high GPU demand for cryptocurrency mining. Blockchain is a long-term growth opportunity for AMD. Intel is behind the competition for the next CPU fabrication node. AMD\u2019s growing CPU advantage over Intel About AMD\u2019s Zen Zen is a technical breakthrough in CPU architecture because it\u2019s a modular design and because it is a small CPU while providing similar or better performance than the Intel competition. Since Zen was released in March 2017, we\u2019ve seen AMD go from 18% CPU market share in the OEM consumer desktops to essentially 50% market share, this was also supported by comments from Lisa Su during the Q3 2017 ER call, by MindFactory.de, and by Amazon sales of CPU\u2019s. We also saw AMD increase its market share of total desktop CPU\u2019s. We also started seeing market share flux between AMD and Intel as new CPU\u2019s are released. Zen is a technical breakthrough supported by a few general guidelines relating to electronics. This provides AMD with an across the board CPU market advantage over Intel for every CPU market addressed. 1) The larger the CPU the lower the yield. - Zen architecture that makes up Ryzen, Threadripper, and EPYC is smaller (44 mm2 compared to 151 mm2 for Coffee Lake). A larger CPU means fewer CPU\u2019s made during fabrication per wafer. AMD will have roughly 3x the fabrication yield for each Zen printed compared to each Coffee Lake printed, therefore each CPU has a much lower cost of manufacturing. 2) The larger the CPU the harder it is to fabricate without errors. - The chance that a CPU will be perfectly fabricated falls exponentially with increasing surface area. Intel will have fewer high quality CPU\u2019s printed compared to AMD. This means that AMD will make a higher margin on each CPU sold. AMD\u2019s supply of perfect printed Ryzen\u2019s (1800X) are so high that the company had to give them away at a reduced cost in order to meet supply demands for the cheaper Ryzen 5 1600X. If you bought a 1600X in August/September, you probably ended up with an 1800X. 3) Larger CPU\u2019s are harder to fabricate without errors on smaller nodes. -The technical capability to fabricate CPU\u2019s at smaller nodes becomes more difficult due to the higher precision that is required to fabricate at a smaller node, and due to the corresponding increase in errors. \u201cA second reason for the slowdown is that it\u2019s simply getting harder to design, inspect and test chips at advanced nodes. Physical effects such as heat, electrostatic discharge and electromagnetic interference are more pronounced at 7nm than at 28nm. It also takes more power to drive signals through skinny wires, and circuits are more sensitive to test and inspection, as well as to thermal migration across a chip. All of that needs to be accounted for and simulated using multi-physics simulation, emulation and prototyping.\u201c Is 7nm The Last Major Node? \u201cSimply put, the first generation of 10nm requires small processors to ensure high yields. Intel seems to be putting the smaller die sizes (i.e. anything under 15W for a laptop) into the 10nm Cannon Lake bucket, while the larger 35W+ chips will be on 14++ Coffee Lake, a tried and tested sub-node for larger CPUs. While the desktop sits on 14++ for a bit longer, it gives time for Intel to further develop their 10nm fabrication abilities, leading to their 10+ process for larger chips by working their other large chip segments (FPGA, MIC) first.\u201d There are plenty of steps where errors can be created within a fabricated CPU. This is most likely the culprit behind Intel\u2019s inability to launch its 10nm fabrication process. They\u2019re simply unable to print such a large CPU on such a small node with high enough yields to make the process competitive. Intel thought they were ahead of the competition with respect to printing large CPU\u2019s on a small node, until AMD avoided the issue completely by designing a smaller modular CPU. Intel avoided any mention of its 10nm node during its Q4 2017 ER, which I interpret as bad news for Intel shareholders. If you have nothing good to say, then you don\u2019t say anything. Intel having nothing to say about something that is fundamentally critical to its success as a company can\u2019t be good. Intel is on track however to deliver hybrid CPU\u2019s where some small components are printed on 10nm. It\u2019s recently also come to light that Intel\u2019s 10nm node is less competitive than the Global Foundries, Samsung, and TSMC 7nm nodes, which means that Intel is now firmly behind in CPU fabrication. 4) AMD Zen is a new architecture built from the ground up. Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s are built on-top of older architecture developed with 30-yr old strategies, some of which we\u2019ve recently discovered are flawed. This resulted in the Meltdown flaw, the Spectre flaws, and also includes the ME, and AMT bugs in Intel CPU\u2019s. While AMD is still affected by Spectre, AMD has only ever acknowledged that they\u2019re completely susceptible to Spectre 1, as AMD considers Spectre 2 to be difficult to exploit on an AMD Zen CPU. \u201cIt is much more difficult on all AMD CPUs, because BTB entries are not aliased - the attacker must know (and be able to execute arbitrary code at) the exact address of the targeted branch instruction.\u201d Technical Analysis of Spectre &amp; Meltdown * r/Amd Further reading Spectre and Meltdown: Linux creator Linus Torvalds criticises Intel's 'garbage' patches | ZDNet FYI: Processor bugs are everywhere - just ask Intel and AMD Meltdown and Spectre: Good news for AMD users, (more) bad news for Intel Cybersecurity agency: The only sure defense against huge chip flaw is a new chip Kernel-memory-leaking Intel processor design flaw forces Linux, Windows redesign Take-Away AMD Zen enjoys a CPU fabrication yield advantage over Intel AMD Zen enjoys higher yield of high quality CPU\u2019s Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s are affected with 40% performance drop due to Meltdown flaw that affect server CPU sales. AMD stock drivers 1) EPYC -A critically acclaimed CPU that is sold at a discount compared to Intel. -Is not affected by 40% software slow-downs due to Meltdown. 2) Raven Ridge desktop APU - Targets unfed GPU market which has been stifled due to cryptocurrency demand - Customers can upgrade to a new CPU or add a GPU at a later date without changing the motherboard. - AM4 motherboard supported until 2020. 3) Vega GPU sales to Intel for 8th generation CPU\u2019s with integrated graphics. - AMD gains access to the complete desktop and mobile market through Intel. 4) Mobile Ryzen APU sales -Providing gaming capability in a compact power envelope. 5) Ryzen and Threadripper sales -Fabricated on 12nm in April. -May eliminate Intel\u2019s last remaining CPU advantage in IPC single core processing. -AM4 motherboard supported until 2020. -7nm Ryzen on track for early 2019. 6) Others: Vega, Polaris, Semi-custom, etc. -I consider any positive developments here to be gravy. Conclusion While in the past Intel interfered with AMD's ability to bring it's products to market, the market has changed. The internet has grown significantly and is now a large market that dominates when in computer sales. It's questionable if Intel still has the influence to affect this new market, and doing so would most certainly result in fines and further bad press. AMD's foundry problems were turned into an advantage over Intel. AMD's more recent past was heavily influenced by the failure of the Bulldozer line of CPU's that dragged on AMD's bottom line from 2011 to 2017. AMD's Zen line of CPU's is a breakthrough that exploits an alternative, superior strategy, in chip design which results in a smaller CPU. A smaller CPU enjoys compounded yield and quality advantages over Intel's CPU architecture. Intel's lead in CPU performance will at the very least be challenged and will more likely come to an end in 2018, until they release a redesigned CPU. I previously targeted AMD to be worth $20 by the end of Q4 2017 ER. This was based on the speed that Intel was able to get products to market, in comparison AMD is much slower. I believe the stock should be there, but the GPU related story was prominent due to cryptocurrency craze. Financial analysts need more time to catch on to what\u2019s happening with AMD, they need an ER that is driven by CPU sales. I believe that the Q1 2018 is the ER to do that. AMD had EPYC stock in stores when the Meltdown and Spectre flaws hit the news. These CPU\u2019s were sold out by mid-January and are large margin sales. There are many variables at play within the market, however barring any disruptions I\u2019d expect that AMD will be worth $20 at some point in 2018 due these market drivers. If AMD sold enough EPYC CPU\u2019s due to Intel\u2019s ongoing CPU security problems, then it may occur following the ER in Q1 2018. However, if anything is customary with AMD, it\u2019s that these things always take longer than expected. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMD.

{"headline": "D-Wave is raising money to bring quantum computing to public cloud", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "Vern Brownell spent the past eight years preaching quantum computing to a world that wasn't ready for it. As CEO of D-Wave Systems, Brownell has been overseeing the development of a type of superfast processor that to date has largely been limited to use in research labs. His Vancouver-based company first raised venture funding back in 2004, five years before he joined.  But this week Brownell is in San Francisco and has plenty of eager listeners on his agenda. Fresh off D-Wave's $50 million in funding from Canada's PSP Investments, Brownell said he's meeting with banks and big investors about raising hundreds of millions of dollars later this year as the company prepares to move into the public cloud. \"We intend to do a very large offering to take advantage of the position we're in,\" Brownell said, in an interview on Thursday. He said the financing \u2014 an alternative to an IPO \u2014 will be led by an investment bank and potentially include sovereign wealth funds and large private equity firms. Brownell has also talked with SoftBank's massive Vision Fund, calling it the type of investor that he would like to see participate. Existing investors include In-Q-Tel, the venture group that invests on behalf of the CIA, and Jeff Bezos' venture firm. Quantum computing differs from classical computing, which is defined by binary code \u2014 1s and 0s. With quantum computing, there are units called qubits that aren't limited to that binary state and have the ability to store dramatically more information. In 2015, Google said that its project with NASA using a D-Wave machine performed certain tasks 100 million times faster than conventional processors. Critical to D-Wave's future is getting this technology into the hands of everyday developers. Until now, researchers at Google, NASA, Lockheed Martin and the Los Alamos National Laboratory have used D-Wave machines, which cost millions of dollars, in complex experiments to see if quantum computing can solve problems in drug discovery, cybersecurity and space exploration. By mid-year, D-Wave's technology will be available in the public cloud for the first time through one of the big three vendors \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft or Google \u2014 Brownell told CNBC. He's not yet able to announce which one will host the service, but said the goal is to eventually be available on multiple platforms. \"I want to be an arms merchant for the cloud providers,\" Brownell said. \"Once one of them has this capability, all of them will want to have it.\" The world clearly needs more powerful processors, as demand explodes for artificial intelligence workloads that require faster and more efficient chips than what's currently available from Nvidia and AMD. But there's a healthy amount of debate among researchers and scientists about whether quantum computers are useful for practical real-world applications.  D-Wave's thumbnail-sized processors are deployed in massive refrigerators that have 18 layers of shielding to protect the quantum state. Last year the company started selling the $15 million 2000Q, which has 2,000 qubits, twice as many as the prior version.  By getting into the public cloud, D-Wave can start letting developers experiment with its technology in much more cost-effective ways. Brownell said they'll even \"be able to use small bits of quantum computing for free.\" Much of the funding that D-Wave plans to raise will go towards hiring software developers as it pushes into the cloud. The company currently has 170 employees, including 40 people in software, Brownell said. D-Wave is far from alone in the market. IBM is building a quantum computer for the commercial world and Microsoft introduced a quantum computing development kit last year. In a January report, Homeland Security Research predicted quantum computing will grow 25 percent a year through 2024, when it will reach $8.45 billion in products and services and $2.25 billion on government-funded research.  The report said that 18 of the world's top companies and dozens of government agencies are working on the processor or software side of quantum computing \"or partnering with the quantum industry start-ups like D-Wave.\" In line with D-Wave's vision, the report had this to say about the many players in the ecosystem: \"Their ambition reflects a broader transition, taking place at start-ups and academic research labs alike: To move from pure science towards engineering.\" ", "author": "Ari Levy", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/d-wave-is-raising-money-to-bring-quantum-computing-to-public-cloud.html"}

Recent news in this area has seen three large companies make their move - The Toyota Tsusho lithium equity off-take deal with Orocobre (OTCPK:OROCF), the SK Innovation cobalt/nickel off-take and equity option deal with Australian Mines (OTC:AMSLF), and now the Posco lithium off-take and equity deal with Pilbara Minerals (OTCPK:PILBF). Next, we are waiting for BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), VW (OTCPK:VLKAF), and others.A quick recap on 2017Last month, I reported on a booming 2017 which saw 2017 total year sales ended at a record 1,223,000, up 58% on 2016, and reaching ~1.4% market share. You can read more here. The following charts show the clear trend of EVs growing well.Global electric cars sales grew 58% in 2017 - and H2 was very strong Global electric car market share in 2017 - averaged ~1.4% and peaked at 2% in December Source: EV-Volumes Global electric car sales as of end January 2018 Global electric car sales finished January 2018 with ~82,000 sales for the month, up 94% on January 2017.Of note, 56% of all global electric car sales so far in 2018 were pure electric, which should rise as the year goes on.China electric car sales were ~35,000 in January 2018, up four-fold on January 2017 (noting January 2017 was a terrible result as subsidies were reduced and there was a licensing crackdown). Electric car market share in China for January 2018 was 1.4% market share.Current subsidies in China were reduced by 20% in 2017 and will be reduced by 40% in 2019 and 100% by 2021. China's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credit system was announced on September 28, 2017, and will begin in 2019 with 10% of credits (12% in 2020) required from new energy vehicles (NEVs). That translates to 4-5% of EV sales as market share for 2019. We are also expecting an announcement at some stage as to when China will ban ICE vehicles, noting BYD Chairman Wang thinks by 2030.Europe electric car sales were almost 26,000 in January 2018, 36% higher than in January 2017. Europe's electric car market share was 2.0% in January 2018. Norway still leads the world with 40% market share of electric cars sold in January.US electric car sales were 12,049 in January 2018.Note: The above sales include light commercial vehicles.Note: An acknowledgement to Jose Pontes of EV Sales and EV Volumes for his excellent work compiling all the electric car sales quoted above and below.Global electric car sales by manufacturer for January 2018 Source: EVSalesAnnual global electric vehicle sales forecast to hit 24.4 million by 2030", "author": "Matt Bohlsen", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4152509-ev-company-news-month-february-2018?source=cnbc"}
{"headline": "SoftBank Vision Fund will invest in 100 companies: CEO Rajeev Misra", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "SoftBank's massive $100 billion Vision Fund will make between 70 and 100 investments in technology firms, CEO Rajeev Misra told CNBC on Monday. Since closing the first major round of investment in May 2017, the Vision Fund has invested in 30 companies, from ride-hailing service Uber to chipmaker Nvidia to Indian e-commerce player Flipkart.  When asked how many companies the Vision Fund would invest in, Misra told CNBC that it would be between 70 and 100 firms.  The fund has already deployed about a third of its capital, according to SoftBank's latest financial release.  Misra said the fund's appeal comes down to the fact that it's a \"patient, long-term\" investor.  \"We do get every call for any company raising significant capital, we get the first call. Not because we have the capital, there's enough capital in this world. Because we have the ecosystem now, and the ecosystem has an exponential effect,\" Misra told CNBC in a TV interview at Mobile World Congress. Misra explained that by \"ecosystem\" he means SoftBank can connect the companies it invests in to each other to see if they can work together, as well as introducing them to new markets. But SoftBank's fund has received some criticism for driving the valuations of private technology companies higher. This has the potential to affect some venture capitalists who may find it harder to invest in funding rounds at higher valuations. Misra said that the Vision Fund has an \"extremely symbiotic\" relationship with venture capitalists and provides liquidity for early investors that got into technology start-ups.  \"The VC community benefits from the Vision Fund because we normally make primary investments into the company. We also buy secondary in all of our investments, from the VCs who really want to exit,\" Misra said. Secondary shares are bought by a new investor from an existing investor.

{"headline": "When Will Nvidia's New GPUs Arrive? - NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Seeking Alpha", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "SummaryProbably not in time for Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference.Nvidia maximizes profit at the expense of market share.Jon Peddie gets it wrong on crypto GPU sales.Revisiting the crypto GPU market split.Rethink Technology business briefs for March 2, 2018. Nvidia's GTC page, source: Nvidia.Nvidia's (NVDA) GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) Technology Conference is coming up later this month, on March 26. GTC has usually been the occasion to announce new GPU architectures, even if new products are months away. There has been much speculation that Nvidia would unveil a successor to Pascal, the current generation of GPUs used in Nvidia's consumer products.The latest and perhaps most authoritative report comes from Tom's Hardware. Igor Wallassek reports that \"nothing concrete\" is likely to be revealed. This is unfortunately consistent with what CEO Jensen Huang stated at the fiscal 2018 Q4 conference call on February 8:...we haven't announced anything for April or July. And so the best way to think about that is, Pascal is the best gaming platform on the planet... we expect Pascal to continue to be world's best gaming platform for the foreseeable future.One might wonder just how long the \"foreseeable future\" is, but it was clear that the rollout of a new consumer graphics architecture wasn't imminent. The Tom's report left open the possibility that next-generation cards might be unveiled sometime in mid summer.The report also indicated a continued divergence between datacenter/professional and consumer cards, with Ampere being the successor to Volta and Turing the successor to Pascal. If true, the nomenclature is somewhat ironic given Turing's interest in artificial intelligence.I've been expecting this divergence as a necessary optimization of the GPU architecture for machine learning applications in order to fend off challenges from alternatives such as ASICs and competing GPUs.Nvidia maximizes profit at the expense of market shareDelaying a new architecture rollout makes sense in terms of maximizing profit on the existing Pascal platform, given the lack of supply/demand balance. During the Q4 call, Nvidia indicated that it was still working to achieve that balance. As long as demand is so high from cryptomining and gaming, it makes sense to simply feed that demand with Pascal cards.The strategy has worked so far, with the Gaming market segment (which includes some crypto) revenue growing 29% y/y to $1.739 billion in fiscal Q4. Assuming that Gaming had at least the same operating margin as the corporate average, then Gaming operating profit was $641 million, growing sequentially by 21%.The strategy also makes sense in light of the roadmap that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) laid out at its Tech Day press conference at CES: Source: AnandTechAnandTech, in its coverage of the event, confirmed that there would be no 12 nm Vega this year: AMD's GPU line will be bypassing the 12nm process used by the Zen+ CPUs, and moving straight to 7nm with Vega. This is a distinct change from previous AMD roadmaps, which had confirmed that we would be seeing Vega on a \"14nm+\" process node, or Vega on the 12nm process. It would appear that the \"12nm\" node is the new name for 14+, but AMD's GPU product line will now be bypassing this completely, despite being \"confirmed\" before. As mentioned above, AMD plans to start sampling a machine learning focused version of Vega on 7nm much later in 2018, where \"sampling\" in this case means pre-testing to select partners. And even Ryzen APUs that include Vega graphics will be fabricated only on 14 nm this year. Thus, the lack of new competition from AMD also seems to mandate a go-slow approach to a Pascal successor.", "author": "Mark Hibben", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4152855-will-nvidias-new-gpus-arrive?source=cnbc"}

The sector makes up 25.1 percent of the S&amp;P 500 as of Tuesday's close, its highest weighting since November 2000 \u2014 a few months before the dotcom bubble burst \u2014 according to data from Bespoke Investment Group.   \"It bears watching for sure,\" Bespoke said in a note Wednesday. \"A weighting of 25%+ is ... nothing to sneeze at.\" Source: Bespoke Investment Group Tech is up 8.4 percent in 2018 and has skyrocketed 35.7 percent over the past year, leaving all other sectors in the dust. Some of the best-performing stocks in the sector over the past year include Nvidia and Micron, both of which are up more than 100 percent in that period. The sector's high weighting may bring up unpleasant memories from when the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, but Bespoke noted valuations for the sector are much lower now than they were back then.  \"At current prices, the Tech sector's forward [price to earnings ratio] stands at just 19.16,\" Bespoke said. \"At its peak in March 2000, the P/E ratio was 60.\" Bespoke also noted that tech's latest move higher in weighting \"has been much more slow and steady\" than in the early 2000s.", "author": "Fred Imbert", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/28/technology-now-makes-up-a-quarter-of-the-stock-market.html"}
{"headline": "Cramer: Buy stocks like Micron to ride the wave of the PC comeback", "tick": "NVDA", "text": "With all the ruckus around free trade, CNBC's Jim Cramer didn't want investors to miss what he called \"one of the greatest stories of the era:\" the comeback of the personal computer. \"It's a tough narrative to swallow,\" the \"Mad Money\" host admitted on Monday. \"I myself didn't believe in it until HP Inc. reported yet another fabulous quarter, at which point the PC's resurgence simply became undeniable.\" HP Inc., once the hardware business of the now-split Hewlett-Packard, handily beat analysts' revenue and profit estimates with its quarterly results. Cramer was shocked by the company's double-digit growth in \"notebooks,\" or laptops, desktops and workstations \u2014 up 14 percent, 17 percent and 11 percent year over year, respectively. HP Inc. has now logged five quarters in a row of double-digit revenue growth, meaning that the most recent quarter's double-digit growth happened on top of last year's double-digit growth. \"For years, the only growth in the industry had come from cellphones,\" Cramer noted. \"Now the numbers are reversed: the PC's roaring while phones have been slowing down.\" This effect isn't just important for computer manufacturers like HP Inc. It also trickles down to computer parts suppliers, specifically chipmakers like Micron, the \"Mad Money\" host said. In fact, Cramer argued that Micron, which makes DRAM and flash memory chips, is the top beneficiary of the PC comeback. Shares of Micron hit a 52-week high on Monday. Market-watchers have been concerned for months that pricing for Micron's chips \u2014 which are subject to a boom-bust cycle \u2014 was on the cusp of breaking down, which would make earnings estimates too high. But HP Inc.'s quarter showed that pricing would remain strong for 2018. \"That means Micron will likely meet or even exceed the numbers, and if that's the case, its stock is way too cheap,\" Cramer said. \"It is a buy on this breakout.\" Stocks like Nvidia, which makes semiconductor chips for a host of industries including PCs, gaming and the data center, and Intel also stand to benefit from the PC comeback, Cramer said. Even shares of companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research, which produce the equipment used to make processing chips, could recover as a result, Cramer said. \"I see tremendous pin action off of Micron. The themes are too great to ignore,\" he concluded. \"The PC suppliers are back and most of them are way too cheap. Even though their stocks have run, I bet they'll end up looking like bargains down the road when these companies start beating their estimates left and right as their underlying business is finally booming again.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia.", "author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/05/cramer-buy-stocks-like-micron-to-ride-the-wave-of-the-pc-comeback.html"}
