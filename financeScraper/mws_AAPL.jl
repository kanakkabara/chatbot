According to documents and sources, Apple has run into a problem at Apple Park: Because so much of the interior is made from glass \u2014 the walls and doors, for example \u2014 people are walking into the panes, sometimes painfully. The company famous for its innovative design experienced at least two incidents of men walking into glass and causing injuries serious enough to warrant calls for local emergency services in the early days of its new \u201cspaceship\u201d campus, according to documents MarketWatch obtained via a public-records request. Both resulted in minor cuts but did not appear to require hospitalization, the records showed. While the issue might seem humorous, there are workplace regulations that Apple could be violating. California that \u201cemployees shall be protected against the hazard of walking through glass by barriers or by conspicuous durable markings,\u201d but the company has not been subject to citations, according to U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration data. If Apple was found to violate the law, it could be subjected to fines and other measures to ensure the company addressed the problem, according to a spokeswoman from the California Department of Industrial relations. Apple Park was expected to open to employees in April 2017, but construction dragged on and employees only began to move in to the office around the beginning of this year, sources said. The company held its first event on the new campus to show off the 10th-anniversary iPhone in September, and , where Chief Executive Tim Cook said employees would begin moving in later in the year. According to records obtained from Santa Clara County, it didn\u2019t take long for these problems to start. The two men \u2014 one an employee, according to the records \u2014 both walked into glass and suffered cuts to the head on Jan. 2. Just heard that the first day Apple Park opened, seven people injured themselves by walking straight into the glass doors. And that's just the people who reported it...as they felt physically hurt... MarketWatch asked Apple for comment on the issue and any mitigations it has sought to enact. Apple did not provide comment in time for publication. The extent of the problem and any steps taken to address it are difficult to determine, as Apple keeps a tight lid on the new campus. Cook said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting earlier this week that the public won\u2019t ever be allowed to see the inside without an Apple badge, and authorities have been called for at least one trespassing complaint in the early days of the new headquarters, according to the records. Some images of the new offices have appeared on Facebook Inc.\u2019s Instagram app, and show very clear glass in plenty of places. Apple\u2019s new headquarters is far from the only modern structure that\u2019s run into problems because of large, transparent surfaces. from the Audubon Society, the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 new football stadium is something of a death trap for birds, killing dozens in several months as members conducted surveys. No word on whether Apple\u2019s much shorter spaceship office suffers from similar issues. Apple stock has gained 27.7% in the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which counts Apple as a component, increased 24.3% in that time. Apple is the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $877.8 billion at Thursday\u2019s closing price of $172.99, according to FactSet.   Max A.

They\u2019re the ones on the sidelines making a few basis points a year from a savings account. What might get them to change their minds? One thing we know for certain is that prices for many stocks are considerably lower than they were when two benchmark indexes hit their all-time closing highs last month. At the end of trading Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index were each down 8% from record closing highs Jan. 26. For some investors, the right \u201centry point\u201d kept slipping further away as the market rose, almost endlessly, since the bull market began about nine years ago. Failing to invest in stocks almost guarantees a smaller nest egg. Maybe it\u2019s time for those on the sidelines to consider making small, but frequent, investments in the stock market.    If you had done so three years ago, you would have gone through some periods of difficulty. But, as you can see on this chart, periods of falling stock prices were actually opportunities. Your small, regular investments would have been purchased at cheaper prices, setting up even bigger gains when the market eventually recovered: In his , Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said \u201cthe years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines \u2014 even panics \u2014 that will affect virtually all stocks.\u201d He also said neither he nor anyone else could predict when panics would take place. Buffett added: \u201cDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, fear is your enemy.\u201d The italics are his. We cannot say what the stock market will do during any given period. But we know for certain that 29 of the 30 Dow stocks were cheaper at the close Feb. 12 compared with the close Jan. 26: You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including price ratios, news and financials. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. were the worst performers in the Dow from Jan. 26 through Feb. 12, as the price of West Texas crude oil declined 10%. On Aug. 23, I published an article saying that might have been the perfect time to buy shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Since then, even with the recent decline, the price of oil has risen 18%, while shares of Exxon Mobil have pulled back slightly and Chevron\u2019s stock has risen 7%. Surely aren\u2019t enough to put the brakes on the positive supply-demand outlook for oil or the growth of the U.S. economy, for that matter. These S&P 500 stocks, most of them widely held in mutual funds and hedge funds, were down at least 15% from Jan. 26 through Feb. 12: Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

The Teflon equity market we\u2019ve known and loved resurfaced yesterday as it marched onward and upward, past inflation data and a pop higher in the 10-year Treasury yield nearer the The VIX is under 20.

Among them is our , which comes from CFRA\u2019s chief investment strategist Sam Stovall, who says the S&P 500 \u201cwill likely have to retest its recent low.\u201d That low came last Thursday, when the S&P careened down to 2,532.69 before snapping back. As Stovall and others have pointed out, the index didn\u2019t break its 200-day moving average, which helped it then slingshot upward more than 6% over the next four trading days. However, the reason a retest can\u2019t be avoided is \u201crecoveries from sharp selloffs require reassurances,\u201d the CFRA strategist says. In other words, investors will need proof that the bounce was for real. The good news? That pullback will \u201cpresent a second buying opportunity, rather than usher in a new bear market, since we don\u2019t see recession on the horizon,\u201d says Stovall. A similar view comes from technical analyst Mark Arbeter, who says there\u2019s more than a \u201c50/50 chance we rollover and test (within 1% to 2%) the recent lows.\u201d A V-shaped bottom is unlikely, \u201cas there was a fair amount of technical damage to a lot of stocks,\u201d the Arbeter Investments president tells clients.

Wall Street opened solidly higher but subsequently lost ground before recouping losses, supported by the latest data on inflation and the labor market, which pointed to an economy that was growing but in no imminent danger of overheating. Strong results at Cisco also highlighted how American corporations continue to fare well in the current environment.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 306.88 points, or 1.2%, to 25,200.37. The S&P 500 added 32.57 points, or 1.2%, to 2,731.20. The Nasdaq Composite gained 112.81 points, or 1.6%, to 7,256.43. So far this week, the Dow and the S&P are both up more than 4% and on track for their biggest weekly percentage rise since November 2016. The Nasdaq is up over 5%, which represents its best week since October 2014. Those gains come after sharp losses seen earlier this month, which pushed the Dow and S&P into correction territory, or a 10% drop from a peak. The three gauges stand between 4% and 6% below last month\u2019s all-time highs. The selloff was sparked in part by rising bond yields amid signs of an uptick in inflation, with the higher yields luring money out of equities. Strategists have said .         \u201cThis is a year of recalibration. In January we recalibrated to higher earnings, and now we\u2019re doing it for higher bond yields, which have been led by potentially higher inflation,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cMarket participants are correctly focusing on inflation, because a rise in inflation can preface an economic slowdown, or an increase in interest rates that could lead to one.\u201d Grohowski remains optimistic about the market, noting that his firm\u2019s year-end target for the S&P 500 was 2,850. However, he expects the recent volatility to persist as investors struggle between the prospect of higher rates on one hand and strong fundamentals on the other. \u201cThis tug of war will be with us for the year, but I think the market is becoming more comfortable with the idea that a little bit of inflation will be OK,\u201d said Grohowski, who helps oversee $238 billion in total client assets. \u201dVolatility could remain a staple of the markets in 2018, but there is no need to panic. Non-recessionary market pullbacks tend to be relatively short-lived, while major one-day market selloffs, historically, are typically followed by better-than average returns,\u201d Joe Quinlan, head of thematic strategy at Bank of America Global Wealth and Investment Management, said in a note to investors. Quinlan shared the following chart which shows how market declines tend to be short-lived when the economy is not in a recession.     In the latest economic data, initial jobless claims , as had been expected, but claims remain near multidecade lows. Separately, , led by a rise in oil prices, though core producer prices were also up by 0.4%. The figure was the latest view on inflation, following Wednesday\u2019s consumer-price index. Two gauges of manufacturing sentiment underscored . The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index rose to 25.8 in February from 22.2 in January. Economists had expected a slight retreat to 21. The Empire State Index, meanwhile slowed to 13.1 in February from 17.7 in January, the New York Fed said.

In addition to a visual overlay, AR may also provide audio and tactile inputs to the user, and rely upon presence and positioning technologies to present location-specific sensory inputs and information to the user. In this manner, AR represents a blending of information technology and media within a real-world environment for the benefit of consumer, business, and industrial users.    Download the full report:     The term Mixed Reality (MR) pertains to a form of hybrid reality in which physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. With MR, either virtual objects are digitally mixed into reality or real-world objects are merged into virtual worlds. The latter case is sometimes referred to as Augmented Virtuality (AV), and is one step closer to Virtual Reality (VR), as real-world objects in a virtual world take on a sense of permanency with real objects, appearing to actually exist within the virtual world.  Adding to this sense of permanency, real-world objects in a virtual world may be digitally controlled. Conversely, MR may also support manipulation of virtual objects permanently placed in the real-world. In either scenario, MR will be an important aspect of teleoperation and tele-robotics.  The primary goal of AR is to enrich the user's perception of the real-world, providing information and insights that otherwise would not be obtainable. AR use cases have grown substantially across many industry verticals within the last two years, providing significant market momentum, and indicating great promise to transform communications, content, and commerce across a wide range of sectors. The goals of MR are broad, yet directionally focused on a true merging of real and virtual worlds, which Mind Commerce believes will be a major catalyst for wide-spread acceptance and usage of VR across all major industry sectors.

Taking cues from another robust session on Wall Street overnight, Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Exchange led gains in Asia, closing up 1.2%, despite a stronger yen. And as expected, Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda was nominated to lead the Bank of Japan for a second term. The markets that are open took their cues from improving investor sentiment this week and gains in global stocks overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 25,000 for the first time since Feb. 2, with market participants expressing greater comfort about the prospect of higher U.S. inflation and Treasury yields. Japanese technology stocks tracked the gains of U.S. counterparts, including Apple , overnight. Kyocera rose 3.8% and Sony gained 1.8%. Japan\u2019s car makers were also higher despite the stronger yen. Honda Motor and Toyota Motor each rose 1%. Improved corporate results despite a stronger yen are supporting investor confidence, said Hiroki Shimazu, chief strategist at MCP Inc. Gains in Japanese stocks came even as the yen was last up 0.2% against the dollar Friday and up 2.7% against the greenback for the week. Yen strength prompted a response from Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso. \u201cStability of foreign exchange rates is important, and there is no change in the government\u2019s stance that it will take appropriate action at the appropriate time, if needed,\u201d he said, escalating his language from a day earlier. In addition to Kuroda\u2019s renomination, the Japanese government also nominated Masazumi Wakatabe and Masayoshi Amamiya for deputy governor positions at the central bank. Amamiya is a career BOJ official. Wakatabe is a professor at Waseda University and is viewed as an advocate of radical easing. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 closed flat, but managed a 1.1% gain for the week, rebounding after a 4.6% tumble last week. New Zealand\u2019s shares climbed 0.8%, helped by a strong rise from one of its biggest stocks. Auckland International Airport jumped 2.8% after saying its first-half profit was higher while narrowing its earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Friday\u2019s gains come despite further losses for Fletcher Building , taking its slide this week to about 10%. The solid gains for the NZX 50 come after the index reached a three-month low earlier in the week.   Join the conversation Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.  All rights reserved.

Deaths on the road reached 40,000 last year, down just 1% from 40,100 in 201, according to a by National Safety Council. These figures remain high despite automatic emergency breaks, plus nationwide seat belt and sober driving campaigns. Traffic deaths exceeded 40,000 in 2016 for the first time since 2006. Some 4.57 million people were seriously injured in motor vehicle crashes in 2017, and costs to society reached nearly $414 billion, also down 1% on the year. \u201cThis is a stark reminder that our complacency is killing us,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, CEO of the National Safety Council. \u201cThe only acceptable number is zero. We need to mobilize a full court press to improve roadway safety.\u201d This is all the more critical, given the increasing amount of time commuters spend in their cars, the number of people who continue to drive above the legal speed limits and the number of people who or with a lack of sleep.    One reason for that complacency: Automobile technology. Drivers who identify as being \u201crarely distracted\u201d engage in behavior they don\u2019t believe is risky: 59% talk on the phone versus 93% for self-described \u201cdistracted\u201d drivers, according to a of more than 1,000 drivers by esurance, an Allstate Corp. auto insurer. Some 77% say they view GPS navigation apps versus 96% for distracted drivers. On the plus side, only 10% of rarely distracted drivers say they text while driving, compared to 63% of distracted drivers. Many in-built features in the latest crop of cars are so distracting they should not be enabled while a vehicle is in motion, according to a separate survey by University of Utah researchers. The study, led by psychology professor David Strayer, found in-vehicle information systems \u2014 including SatNav, MP3 players, radios, cellphones and messaging devices \u2014 take drivers\u2019 attention off the road for too long to be safe, much like texting.   \u2022 The No. 1 most distracting task: Programming navigation devices \u2022 The No. 2. most distracting task: Sending or receiving text messages \u2022 The No. 2. most distracting task: Audio entertainment and making calls Accident data shows people still text when they drive, but SatNav is actually more dangerous when used while the car is in motion. \u201cWith the best intentions, we will put some technology in the car that we think will make the car safer, but people being people will use that technology in ways that we don\u2019t anticipate,\u201d Strayer said. Greater consideration should be given to what manufacturers install in cars in order to make them more appealing to drivers, he added. The study, which was conducted for the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety, a nonprofit organization in Heathrow, Fla., reviewed found in-vehicle information systems in 30 different 2017 vehicles. Participants were required to engage in four types of tasks using voice, touch screen and other interactive technologies. The tasks were to make a call, send a text message, tune the radio or program navigation while driving.   Drivers using features such as voice-based and touch-screen technology took their hands, eyes and mind off the road for more than 24 seconds to complete tasks, the study found. This is enough to put the drive at risk of a serious accident: Previous research from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that the risk of a crash doubles when a driver takes his or her eyes off the road for two seconds. Worse, programming navigation took an average of 40 seconds to complete. Federal law prohibits train engineers from using cellphones, but there\u2019s no federal ban on car drivers. Some 15 states and the District of Columbia, however, do have bans on handheld cellphone use \u2014 including New York, New Jersey and California \u2014 and 47 states and D.C. explicitly ban texting (Washington was the first state to ban texting, in 2007). That means it\u2019s up to drivers to regulate their own behavior, especially when it comes to the car\u2019s in-built features.   Driving while using a cellphone reduces brain activity associated with driving \u2014 \u201cspatial processing\u201d that helps drivers remember and make sense of the objects on the street \u2014 by 37%, according to a 2008 research paper by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Some 10% of fatal crashes, 15% of injury crashes and 14% of all police-reported motor vehicle traffic crashes in 2015 were reported as \u201c \u201d crashes. Cellphone use is estimated to be involved in 26% of all motor vehicle crashes, a 2013 National Safety Council study found. But it\u2019s not texting \u2014 widely regarded as the scourge of road accidents \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest problem. Only 5% of cellphone-related crashes involve texting, while the other 21% involve drivers talking on handheld or hands-free cellphones. This risky behavior obviously poses a danger to vehicle occupants as well as pedestrians and bicyclists.   New York state\u2019s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, told the Associated Press in July that the state is testing technology that will allow police to identify drivers who are texting and driving. \u201cThis review will examine the effectiveness of using this new emerging technology to crack down on this reckless behavior and thoroughly evaluate its implications,\u201d he told the AP. The technology is being developed by Cellebrite, an Israeli-based technology company. Apple wants to stop drivers from texting in the first place by hanging a \u201cDo Not Disturb While Driving\u201d sign on their iPhone\u2019s iOS 11. It allows a driver to mute text messages without having to turn the phone off. The screen will go black. Again, this relies on the driver to initiate and doesn\u2019t deal with the multiple distractions or \u201c \u201d that already exist in most cars \u2014 including Apple CarPlay, which can show everything from messaging apps to audiobooks.

That\u2019s because Equifax \u2014 at least according to \u2014 is the most hated company in America right now, while Apple is on Fortune magazine\u2019s recently-released list of . Shares of the most-hated companies historically have outperformed most-admired ones, on average. This isn\u2019t to say that Equifax is the better company in any fundamental sense. Apple clearly deserves admiration, having shown an uncanny ability to produce product after product that consumers want. Apple is projected to earn over $50 billion dollars this year, and famed investor . Equifax, in contrast, suffers from not only having allowed a huge data breach last year but also not immediately informing consumers of that breach. It likely will incur huge direct costs in cleaning up its mess \u2014 even more from damage to its reputation. Note carefully, however, that your profit when investing in these or any stocks is not only a function of their underlying economic fundamentals. It\u2019s also a function of their performance relative to investor expectations. Since expectations of Apple\u2019s performance are already sky high, it will have to perform spectacularly in order to not disappoint investors. In contrast, since expectations of Equifax are so low, it won\u2019t take much to beat them. A horse racing analogy can be helpful here. Imagine a 10-horse race in which any finisher pays off. One horse is the overwhelming favorite while another is expected to come in last. Imagine further that the favorite horse finishes second, while the horse that was expected to come in last instead finishes seventh out of the 10. It\u2019s not inconceivable that you would make more money having bet on the horse than came in seventh than the one that came in second \u2014 even though the second-place horse was a faster horse. Moreover, these theoretical hunches have been verified empirically, according to a by two finance professors: Deniz Anginer, a financial economist in the Development Research Group at the World Bank, and Meir Statman, a finance professor at Santa Clara University. The researchers constructed two hypothetical portfolios out of the stocks on Fortune\u2019s annual list \u2014 one each for the most-admired and the most-despised companies on the list. Over a close to 25-year period through December 2007, the Despised Company portfolio outperformed the Admired Portfolio by nearly two percentage points per year, on average. In addition, the researchers found that increases in admiration were followed by lower returns, on average. (See chart, below.) To be sure, a company\u2019s placement on the admiration-hated spectrum is just one data point to include in your analysis. You shouldn\u2019t always avoid admired companies and invest in despised ones. One other factor you might want to take into account when considering a despised company is whether it is currently recommended by a market-beating adviser. Equifax jumps over this hurdle, : Teal Linde, editor of the Linde Equity Report, recommended Equifax soon after its stock plummeted in the wake of the data breach. Below are other companies on 24/7\u2019s Most Hated list that currently are recommended by at least one of the market-beating advisers I track: \u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cigna  \u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comcast  \u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electronic Arts  \u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Facebook  \u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wells Fargo  It can be hard to invest in a company that is on a most-hated list.

After all, he\u2019s the Oracle. The folksy host of the \u201cWoodstock for capitalists.\u201d Bill Gates\u2019s bridge-playing buddy. And, as Dayen points out, Obama and Clinton hailed his endorsements, while Bernie Sanders backed his take on taxes.

But there\u2019s a dark side to all this, according to Dayen. \u201c[M]onopoly power and the unfair advantages it provides\u201d is the driving force behind Buffett\u2019s massive fortune, in Dayen\u2019s view. \u201cCompanies in Buffett\u2019s portfolio have extorted windfall profits, ripped off taxpayers, and abused customers,\u201d he says, adding that Buffett \u201cmakes no secret of his fondness for monopoly. He repeatedly highlights the key to his personal fortune: finding businesses surrounded by a monopoly moat, keeping competitors at bay.\u201d Moat-wise, Buffett has said as much. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor, you\u2019ve got a very good business,\u201d Buffett once said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good enough business, if you have a monopoly newspaper or if you have a network television station, your idiot nephew could run it.\u201d And at a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting back in 2000, he said that \u201cwe think in terms of that moat and the ability to keep its width and its impossibility of being crossed. We tell our managers we want the moat widened every year.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t sit well with Dayen. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t supposed to allow moats, much less reward them,\u201d he writes in the piece. \u201cOur economic system, we claim, is founded on free and fair competition. We have laws over a century old designed to break up concentrated industries, encouraging innovation and risk-taking. In other words, Buffett\u2019s investment strategy should not legally be available, to him or anyone else.\u201d Dayen says, however, that the government has hasn\u2019t done nearly enough, beyond just Buffett, to curb the proliferation of the problem. \u201cThe United States has not only failed to build bridges across monopoly moats; it has stocked those moats with alligators,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis consolidation has vastly inflated corporate profits, damaged workers and consumers, stunted economic growth, and supercharged economic inequality.\u201d Buffett has played a key role in the trend, Dayen claims. \u201cBuffett isn\u2019t following America on the road to oligarchy; he\u2019s leading it,\u201d he charges, before launching into examples of Buffett\u2019s \u201chunger for monopoly,\u201d such as VeriSign and his aggressive move into the airline sector. Dayen also writes about the hypocrisy of Buffett\u2019s pleas for tax fairness while he maintains a $22 billion stake in Apple \u201cperhaps America\u2019s most notorious corporate-tax evader.\u201d The iPhone maker is his third-biggest position, behind Wells Fargo and Kraft Heinz . \u201cGetting serious about taming monopolies also means ceasing the endless praise of Warren Buffett,\u201d Dayen concludes. \u201cThe path to solving America\u2019s inequality crisis goes through Omaha and the cuddly billionaire whose love of monopoly is contributing to national desperation.\u201d Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles.

With the bull market turning nine years old this spring, you can expect more. There is a sensible approach for these times. Every investor should consider it. To understand the approach, let us start with two charts.   Please click for annotated chart of the stock market when it was recently in the middle of a violent correction. The chart was published on Feb. 9 when the stock market was looking downright scary to many investors. The chart shows two scenarios. At that time, The Arora Report said: \u201cThe probability of a bullish W pattern forming is significantly higher than a bearish break.\u201d For more analysis of the chart, please see \u201c .\u201d Please click to see how the W bullish pattern has evolved. The chart also shows The Arora Report calls, as provided in real time to The Arora Report subscribers. The charts are of S&P 500 futures Similar conclusions can be drawn from popular ETFs such as S&P 500 ETF Nasdaq 100 ETF and small-cap ETF It is more instructive to use a futures chart because futures trade overnight and there is a very important point on the chart that is visible only on that chart.       Here are some, but not all, simple ingredients of a sensible approach that every investor should consider. \u2022 When there is risk in the markets, hold an adequate level of cash. Cash not only protects you when the market falls, it enables you to invest in new opportunities at better prices. \u2022 Use hedges. Hedges are like an insurance policy. You buy them when it appears you do not need them and they are cheap. You cash out partially when everybody wants them and they become expensive. As an example, we booked huge profits on hedges during the correction. The profit-taking points are shown on the second chart linked above. \u2022 Using hedges allows you to hold on to good long-term positions. \u2022 Hold a core portfolio, such as The Arora Report Model Portfolio, for the long term. If aggressive, surround the core portfolio with other positions. comprehensive timing model that has macro, fundamental, technical and inter-market inputs from across the globe. Also, use a timing model, such as The Arora Report\u2019s ZYX Global Multi Asset Allocation, which has inputs in 10 categories. Please click to see the 10 categories. \u2022 Buy on pullbacks in the buy zone. \u2022 Scale in and scale out. \u2022 Make decisions based on hard analytical data and not out of mere opinions or emotions.      Looking ahead over the next few months, it is not all-clear yet for stock market investors. If you were uncomfortable at the depth of the correction, consider taking advantage of the strength in the market to trim some positions. Also consider taking advantage of the strength to raise come cash and establish hedges. The Arora Report\u2019s basic stance is to hold good long-term positions but take prudent protective measures. We provide specific protective measures to our subscribers such as appropriate cash levels, appropriate hedges, appropriate position sizes, which positions to trim and which positions to add along with buy zones. During this rebound, the momo (momentum) crowd has rushed into popular stocks such as Apple Amazon Facebook Alphabet  Nvidia and AMD It is time to review that your portfolio is not overly concentrated in positions like those. As the shows, the \u201csmart money\u201d (professional investors) is lightly selling into the strength. In the days preceding the start of the correction, we were repeatedly informing our subscribers that the smart money was doing this. At the depth of the correction, the smart money lightly bought stocks.

Fox was in its second season of airing \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the No. 2 and 3 show that year \u2014 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d aired on two different nights \u2014 according to Nielsen data. But power is shifting to streaming services, which have direct lines to the viewers that networks and show creators like Murphy are trying to reach. Earlier this week, Murphy and his production company signed a five-year deal with Netflix worth a reported $300 million. Murphy has a few months left on his current deal with Fox. \u201cEmboldened by the success of original programming, Netflix has now become the actual studio making original programming,\u201d wrote BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield in a blog post. \u201cIt appears that Netflix may be moving toward its next inflection point, as content increasingly shifts toward internally produced projects created by the biggest names in television.\u201d Last August, Netflix wooed \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes away from Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC network. The streaming giant has also inked deals with \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes\u201d director Matt Reeves, \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d creator Jenji Kohan and \u201cStranger Things\u201d producer Shawn Levy. Netflix\u2019s recent focus on signing exclusive production deals with creators is a departure from the third-party licensing model that helped it grow its subscriber base. Netflix is still committed to buying series from third-party producers, but Greenfield expects the mix to shift meaningfully. The company\u2019s ramped push into original content came as networks began questioning whether they should . Increasingly, the belief is that TV networks and legacy media companies . Disney announced plans last year to launch its own streaming service in 2019, and in doing so will pull all of its content from Netflix. As this happens, the competition for talent and intellectual property has intensified. Netflix\u2019s deals with Murphy and Rhimes are a testament to that.    \u201cJust as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals, we are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators,\u201d Netflix management said in its 2017 third-quarter letter to shareholders. But this shift isn\u2019t exclusive to Netflix, Greenfield points out. Amazon.com Inc. paid a reported $250 million for the rights to a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series, and to an exclusive overall deal. Horgan co-created and stars in Amazon\u2019s comedy series \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d Apple Inc. which is fairly new to the landscape, shelled out upwards of $1.25 million per episode, according to , to nab Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s upcoming morning-show drama. But it\u2019s increasingly expensive, as these deals indicate, to acquire the talent and content necessary to be successful.       Netflix plans to spend close to $8 billion on content in 2018, and another $2 billion on marketing that content. So the company, which is already swimming in debt, will have to tap high-yield markets again to fuel its expensive, but necessary, investments. This all puts a lot of leverage on the side of creators. during the TCA press tour in January that he had concerns about Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid to buy Fox, and what that would mean for his creative freedom. A month later, he\u2019s out the door. \u201cThe challenge facing the legacy media companies who own film and television studios is that they do not own their greatest assets, meaning the talent itself,\u201d Greenfield wrote. \u201cWe sense the tech platforms have all realized that you do not need to spend up to buy studios, when all you need to be a major player in Hollywood is money \u2014 a lot of money \u2014 to acquire talent and produce content yourself.\u201d Trey Williams reports for MarketWatch from New York.
