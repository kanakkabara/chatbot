Cook was asked if shareholders would receive a special dividend this year as part of Apple bringing hundreds of billions of dollars in cash back to the U.S. The CEO said he\u2019s \"not a fan\" of special dividends but said the company\u2019s board remains \"committed\" to annual dividend increases. Directors will discuss the issue in April, as in previous years, he noted at the meeting inside the company\u2019s new Steve Jobs Theater, in Cupertino, California. Cook also made some of his most explicit comments on succession planning, saying that one of his most important roles as CEO is properly \"passing the baton\" to a new leader. Every Apple board meeting in recent years has had succession planning on the agenda for all key executive roles, he said. The comments were prompted by a question on Cook\u2019s succession and that of Jony Ive, the company\u2019s chief design officer. Cook, 57, was named CEO in 2011, succeeding Jobs. Ive returned to his management role in December. The CEO was also quizzed on the mobile payments industry. While Apple Pay has an \"extraordinary future ahead of it,\" the acceptance of mobile payments has taken off slower than he expected, Cook said. Still, there\u2019s been rapid adoption over the past year in Japan, China and Russia, he added. Asked about diversity, Cook said half of Apple\u2019s hires last year were either female or underrepresented minorities.", "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/"}
{"headline": "Apple Has a Deep Bench of Potential Tim Cook Successors - Bloomberg", "author": "By ", "tick": "AAPL", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/apple-executive-bench-is-deep-as-ceo-succession-question-raised", "text": ". Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook addressed succession at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, saying that eventually \"passing the baton\" properly is one of his most important roles. The company has a deep bench of experienced managers who could fill Cook\u2019s shoes when the time comes. Apple\u2019s leadership team includes 10 executives other than Cook and features veterans like operations chief Jeff Williams, services head Eddy Cue, product marketing boss Phil Schiller, and hardware leader Dan Riccio. There are also relative newcomers, like Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and retail head Angela Ahrendts, who brought leadership experience from other companies. At the meeting in Cupertino, California, Cook said every Apple board meeting in recent years has had succession planning on the agenda for all key executive roles, but he didn\u2019t specify any potential successors. Cook, 57, has been CEO since succeeding Steve Jobs in 2011. He\u2019s led an explosion in revenue and profit, while\u00a0expanding services like music streaming and overseeing the launch of the Apple Watch, iPhone X and HomePod. There\u2019s no reason to believe Cook is planning to step down any time soon. And\u00a0given how far off his departure may be, it\u2019s possible a successor isn\u2019t even on the executive team yet. But Cook\u2019s comments marked a new level of specificity on the topic. Apple declined to comment beyond the CEO\u2019s remarks. Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, would probably be Cook\u2019s most likely successor if the CEO were to step down in the immediate future. Williams, who like Cook is an operations maestro, manages the company\u2019s global supply chain, which churns out the iPhones, iPads, and Macs that generate the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue. He\u2019s also taken on a more public profile in recent years by managing the Apple Watch\u2019s development and announcing new health features at press conferences. Ahrendts, who came to Apple in 2014 to run its retail division, was formerly the CEO of Burberry Group Plc where she engineered a turnaround of the luxury goods maker. She has been discussed as a potential successor to Cook because of her experience and ability to connect with employees and customers. \"Fake news, fake news, silly, no,\" Ahrendts said to BuzzFeed News when asked about succession last year. Still, she would instantly become one of the most powerful women in the business world as the leader of the most-valuable public company. Apple is trying to increase diversity, and naming Ahrendts as CEO would shake up a technology industry criticized for its male-dominated culture. Another possibility would be Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive. He oversees the software running on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Siri, and has quickly become one of the most public facing and important leaders at the company. He has the ear of Apple developers and runs a complex organization of thousands of software engineers working on future iPhone features. \"I see my role as CEO to prepare as many people as I can to be CEO and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing and then the board makes a decision at that point in time,\" Cook said in the same BuzzFeed interview as Ahrendts. At the shareholder meeting on Tuesday, Cook was also asked about the eventual succession of\u00a0Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. Cook didn\u2019t comment on specific executives. In 2015, Ive shifted management responsibilities to a pair of design vice presidents, Alan Dye and Richard Howarth, while he focused on the design of the company\u2019s new Apple Park campus. In December, Ive regained his management duties.", "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/"}

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported that it cut its stake in Big Blue by 94 percent during the fourth quarter, essentially drawing to a close a rare blemish on his investing record. The move was disclosed in a regulatory filing Wednesday that also showed Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire increased its investment in Apple Inc., now valued at nearly $28 billion. And it initiated a new holding in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., worth about $365 million, in the final three months of last year. IBM was always a curiosity for Buffett followers. He\u2019d spent years telling them that technology companies were outside his area of expertise then plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011. Back then, Buffett\u2019s investment was a huge vote of confidence for the aging computer-services firm and its leadership. But things soon went south. IBM struggled with declining sales, forcing Buffett to defend the pick. For awhile, he even added some to his holdings. Last year, however, he\u2019d had enough. Just before Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he acknowledged that his valuation had been flawed and that he\u2019d begun to on the investment. Buffett had hinted he might sell additional IBM shares before the end of last year. Since some of the stock traded below his purchase price, it would have been for Berkshire to recognize a loss when tax rates were higher, he said this January. Berkshire\u2019s stake in the company stood at just 2 million shares at the end of December, which have a market value of about $309 million. The episode has highlighted just how badly Buffett opportunities in tech companies that have come to dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable enterprises. At the annual meeting, he issued a mea culpa, adding that he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to invest early in Google despite having plenty of chances to learn about and understand its business model. In a sign of his new thinking, Buffett plowed billions of dollars into Apple starting in 2016. He added more to that investment in the fourth quarter, boosting Berkshire\u2019s total stake in the iPhone maker by 23 percent to about 165 million shares. While much smaller, Berkshire\u2019s new investment in Teva may capture investor attention. The drugmaker has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years. New Chief Executive Officer Kare Schultz has been making major changes since taking over in November. He\u2019s told investors to brace for an ugly ride that won\u2019t be over this year, and gave a 2018 earnings forecast far . To clean up some of the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt, Schultz said he\u2019ll cut about at the company -- a step that past CEOs have been unwilling to take given Teva\u2019s close ties to its home market in Israel. He\u2019s also the drugmaker\u2019s management, and said it will eliminate some money-losing products. After Berkshire\u2019s new holding was disclosed, Teva\u2019s American Depository Receipts surged 8 percent.

Given the HomePod\u2019s $349 price, that $216 cost suggests Apple is generating margins of about 38 percent, according to the product analysis firm. That compares with margins of 66 percent and 56 percent for the Google Home and Amazon Echo, products that compete in the smart-speaker market, but offer lower audio quality, according to the firm\u2019s estimates. \u201cApple is compressing their margins a bit, wanting to go big or go home,\u201d said Al Cowsky, TechInsight\u2019s costing manager. \u201cIn doing so, I suspect they reduced the selling price from a normal Apple margin in order to sell more units on volume.\u201d For comparison, the Cupertino, California-based company generates margins of 64 percent on the flagship iPhone X, according to a materials teardown by IHS Markit. A $349 original Apple Watch from 2015 was estimated by IHS to cost only $84 for the materials. Apple\u2019s latest hardware product has won praise for its sound quality but criticism for the lack of smooth integration with the Siri digital voice assistant and the inability to work tightly with some popular outside applications, unlike its rivals. Apple, like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, wants the HomePod to keep consumers tied to its system of services like its music subscription. The bulk of the HomePod\u2019s costs come from the internal speaker technology, including the many microphones, tweeters, the woofer and the power management components. That adds up to $58, while an additional $60 includes various smaller parts like the lighting system used to display the Siri animation on the top of the device. The HomePod\u2019s A8 chip is estimated to cost $25.50, while the external housing and other items come in at $25. TechInsights also estimates manufacturing, testing, and packaging to add up to $17.50. Apple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the HomePod materials analysis.

There\u2019s been one hiccup since it opened last year: Apple employees keep smacking into the glass. Surrounding the building, located\u00a0in\u00a0Cupertino, California,\u00a0are 45-foot tall curved panels of safety glass. Inside are work spaces, dubbed \u201cpods,\u201d also made with a lot\u00a0of glass. Apple staff are often glued to the\u00a0iPhones\u00a0they helped popularize. That\u2019s resulted in repeated cases of distracted employees walking into the\u00a0panes, according to people familiar with the incidents. Some staff started to stick Post-It notes on the glass doors\u00a0to mark their presence. However, the notes were removed because they detracted from the building\u2019s design, the\u00a0people said. They asked not to be identified discussing anything related to Apple. Another person familiar with the situation said there are other markings to identify\u00a0the glass. Apple\u2019s latest campus has been\u00a0lauded as an architectural marvel. The building, crafted\u00a0by famed architect Norman Foster, immortalized a vision that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had years earlier. In 2011, Jobs reportedly described the building \u201ca little like a spaceship landed.\u201d Jobs has been\u00a0credited for coming up with the glass pods, designed to mix\u00a0solo\u00a0office areas with more social spaces.

It\u2019s not clear how many incidents there have been. A Silicon Valley-based spokeswoman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration referred questions about Apple\u2019s workplace safety record to the government agency\u2019s website. A search on the site based on\u00a0Apple\u2019s name\u00a0in California found no reports of injuries at the company\u2019s new campus. It\u2019s not the first time Apple\u2019s penchant for glass in buildings has caused problems. In late 2011, 83-year-old Evelyn Paswall walked into the glass wall of an Apple store, breaking her nose. She sued the company, arguing it\u00a0should have posted a warning\u00a0on the glass. The suit was settled without\u00a0any cost to Apple, according to a legal filing in early 2013.", "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/"}

We still have capacity to increase by 15 million bearings annually by using space in existing factories in Thailand, which will bring capacity to 300 million by May or June. But it is becoming necessary to invest in new factories. We\u2019re considering possible locations. We\u2019ve already invested 8 billion yen in expanding capacity, but that was within existing locations. To build infrastructure for a brand-new factory requires a number that has an extra digit. That\u2019s why we have to consider it very seriously. I can\u2019t speak about short-term earnings, but when we laid out our medium-term plan last May we expected operating profit to reach 100 billion yen by March 2021. It\u2019s beginning to look like we can arrive at that number a year early. Our customer is doing very well. We won\u2019t know next fiscal year\u2019s numbers until March. But we\u2019re not a supplier, we\u2019re an assembler. We can deal with bigger demand and won\u2019t need additional investment. The increase in efficiency is going faster than expected. The business is doing better as our customer is selling more units, but also because of our improved profitability. We\u2019re actually doing better than expected. People make a big deal about how great OLED is, but\u00a0it\u2019s hard to see the screen in daylight. And if you put three OLED screens next to each other, they\u2019ll all show slightly different colors. LCD isn\u2019t going to go away completely.", "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/"}
{"headline": "Big Tech Stages White House Lobbying Blitz: The Influence Game - Bloomberg", "author": "By ", "tick": "AAPL", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/big-tech-stages-white-house-lobbying-blitz-the-influence-game", "text": "The world's biggest technology providers saw\u00a0an opening and a threat late last summer\u00a0as the White House prepared a report that could influence billions of dollars in government spending on computing contracts. Amazon.com Inc., Oracle Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp. all sought to make their voices heard\u00a0as a key advisory panel named by President Donald Trump drafted recommendations on modernizing federal use of cloud services\u00a0and other technology. Their outreach was aimed at the American Technology Council -- headed by a onetime Microsoft finance chief Chris Liddell -- and took the form of letters spelling out how the administration ought to reshape its tech policy. That effort to influence the Trump advisory panel is one small part of the industry's push\u00a0to make its presence felt more deeply in Washington before a new, self-proclaimed business-friendly administration. Even as lawmakers and regulators increase scrutiny of the tech sector, the letters show how companies are jousting indirectly with each other for what could be lucrative new work with the government. It continues a long trend\u00a0of increased lobbying activity by tech\u00a0giants.\u00a0According to a Bloomberg analysis of Senate disclosures dating back to 2000,\u00a0lobbying of the White House and its key bureaus by\u00a0U.S. tech companies has increased steadily, with an acceleration\u00a0in\u00a0the past six years. In 2000, only Microsoft,\u00a0Apple Inc., and Oracle\u00a0disclosed lobbying then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, including offices potentially representing his closest advisers.\u00a0Disclosures filed with the government show that, in 2017, lobbyists working for Airbnb Inc., Amazon, Apple, Facebook Inc., Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. sought to influence parts of the Executive Office of the President -- which includes Trump\u2019s inner circle and key bureaus such as the ATC, the Office of Management and\u00a0Budget, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThe biggest tech companies have shifted gears and put a lot resources into lobbying and into the executive branch in particular,\" said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for nonprofit Public Citizen.\u00a0Oracle declined to comment, while other tech companies didn\u2019t respond to requests. The companies are pressing the\u00a0White House on a range of topics. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple all lobbied on immigration in 2017, for instance, with Google specifying that it worked on issues related to Trump's proposed travel bans. Apple disclosed lobbying the White House on tax\u00a0as the administration and Congress crafted a new law that changed taxes on offshore cash held by U.S. companies. Apple has since decided to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars and pay about $38 billion in tax on the money. Trump too is\u00a0working to foster relationships with technology companies. In March,\u00a0he created the White House Office of American Innovation, run by his son-in-law Jared Kushner. The initiative aims to collect ideas from business leaders in different industries to help the White House modernize the government\u2019s technology, develop a \u201cworkforce of the future\u201d program and address the opioid epidemic. In the simmering battle over\u00a0the government\u2019s IT procurement strategy, tech companies presented divergent perspectives. Ken Glueck,\u00a0an Oracle policy executive,\u00a0warned ATC\u2019s Liddell\u00a0in a letter that\u00a0the administration\u2019s efforts to modernize the government\u2019s IT systems \u201care not only likely to fail, but also put the taxpayer at substantial security risk.\u201d A copy of the letter was by the General Services Administration, which oversees procurement. Oracle signed\u00a0more than $400 million in unclassified contracts with the federal government\u00a0in the last five fiscal years, according to\u00a0Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Bach. Oracle \u201cis trying to preserve its market share,\u201d said Lydia Leong, an analyst\u00a0at Gartner.\u00a0\u201cObviously they also see the opportunity to grow.\u201d By contrast, two Amazon executives wrote in a separate letter that the company\u00a0strongly supports the administration\u2019s push to boost innovation, modernize federal IT systems and migrate\u00a0to commercial cloud infrastructure.\u00a0Amazon\u2019s cloud division\u00a0has already won\u00a0a multi-year CIA contract, while an affiliate landed\u00a0a separate\u00a0$950 million cloud contract with the Pentagon earlier this month.\u00a0Oracle and other tech companies and trade groups have questioned the Amazon cloud\u00a0security model and said\u00a0there\u2019s insufficient competition in awards like these. Amazon, which has grown its lobbying operation faster and more widely than\u00a0competitors in recent years, has been positioning itself carefully in Washington.\u00a0Lobbying disclosures show that\u00a0former Trump Florida campaign finance chairman Brian Ballard approached the White House as an outside lobbyist on Amazon\u2019s behalf over tax issues and also lobbied Vice President Mike Pence's office on trade and taxes for the online retailer. Former Trump campaign official Robert Wasinger\u00a0also worked for Amazon on\u00a0online sales tax matters as an outside lobbyist for the company. Amazon also disclosed lobbying on aviation and copyright issues at the White House. Oracle has stepped up too. Oracle\u2019s Safra\u00a0Catz was one of the first Silicon Valley CEOs\u00a0to embrace Trump, and was said to have been for a spot in his administration. The company also hired Josh Pitcock, a former chief of staff to\u00a0Pence, as a government affairs executive, according to Politico. Its corporate political action committee\u00a0and executives gave a combined\u00a0$29,300 to Representative Devin Nunes, who has emerged as one of the president\u2019s top defenders in Congress. The tech giants\u2019 White House outreach\u00a0didn\u2019t begin under Trump: Tech workers and executives donated heavily to\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s campaign and started paying more attention to the White House after he was elected. The Obama administration often partnered with tech leaders on policy initiatives such as educating consumers on computer viruses\u00a0or resettling refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. In 2009, Obama\u00a0tapped former Virginia Secretary of Technology Aneesh Chopra to become the nation\u2019s first ever Chief Technology Officer. \u00a0Silicon Valley fostered the relationship too\u00a0and\u00a0some former executives joined his administration. Now tech companies are treading less-friendly waters in Washington.\u00a0Companies including Google, Facebook\u00a0and Twitter\u00a0are being criticized by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle\u00a0for a plethora of issues ranging from their dominance of certain markets to allowing their platforms to be exploited by Russian operatives spreading misinformation to influence elections.\u00a0Some lawmakers have slammed Apple for courting Chinese authorities and for slowing down older iPhones to avoid abrupt shutdowns. \"I call it the bipartisan Silicon Valley squeeze,\" said Bret Swanson, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Silicon Valley going back\u00a020 to 15 years, always had a halo around its head. For the first time it is exposed to real political pressures.\" These days, with unpredictable tweets and policy decisions coming from the White House, any lobbyist needs to be finding a way to engage,\u00a0said Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.", "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/"}
