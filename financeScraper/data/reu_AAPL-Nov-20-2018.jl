Shares of Apple Inc fell 3.8 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the company had cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September. The iPhone maker\u2019s stock, which has played a major role in powering a decade-long bull run for equities, is down nearly 20 percent from a record high in October following a disappointing holiday-quarter sales forecast and weak outlook from several of its suppliers. The stock was the biggest drag on the technology sector, which fell 3.3 percent and was the top loser among the 11 major S&P sectors trading in the red. Consumer discretionary stocks tumbled 2.1 percent and communication services fell 2.7 percent. \u201cWithout the FANG leadership, including Apple, the market is going to struggle,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Trading volumes were thin in a holiday-shortened week ahead of Thanksgiving on Thursday and a shorter session on Friday which brings a slight volatility to markets, traders said.

The rest of the FAANG group - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc - shed between 3 percent and 4.8 percent.

Concerns about slowing economic growth also pushed down the dollar. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped as much as 2 percent following a decline in shares of Apple and its suppliers. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple had cut production orders in recent weeks for the iPhone models it launched in September. Renewed tensions between China and the United States also weighed. At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the issue prevented leaders from agreeing on a communique, the first time such an impasse had occurred in the group\u2019s history. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways. \u201cWe\u2019re just in an uncertain period for the economy, largely because of trade and trade issues,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u201cIf (U.S. President) Trump came out and said he was very optimistic about the G20 meeting, or if (Chinese President) Xi came out and said that, this market would turn on a dime.\u201d The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 405.46 points, or 1.6 percent, to 25,007.76, the S&P 500 lost 42.58 points, or 1.56 percent, to 2,693.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 196.26 points, or 2.71 percent, to 7,051.61. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.89 percent. Mixed signals regarding the Federal Reserve\u2019s course of rate hikes in the face of a potential economic slowdown has also weighed on markets, investors said. Federal Reserve policymakers have recently raised concern about a potential global slowdown, leading some market watchers to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run. Data released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders showed weakening sentiment in the U.S. housing market, adding to concerns over economic growth. Still, New York Fed President John Williams stated that the U.S. central bank is moving ahead with its plans for gradual rate hikes as it marches toward a more normal policy stance. Reflecting growth concerns and the possibility that the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle may soon end, the dollar dropped to a two-week low on Monday. The dollar index fell 0.28 percent. In similar fashion, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its lowest level in more than a month. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 3.0592 percent, from 3.074 percent late on Friday. In Europe, Renault SA shares helped push the STOXX 0.7 percent lower as Carlos Ghosn, the joint chairman of Renault and Nissan Motor Co, was arrested for alleged financial misconduct. Gold found support from the drop in the dollar and added 0.1 percent to $1,223.08 an ounce. Oil prices edged up in choppy trade as they found support from a reported drawdown of U.S. inventories, potential European Union sanctions on Iran and possible OPEC production cuts. Brent crude futures settled at $66.79 a barrel, up 3 cents. U.S. crude futures settled at $56.76 a barrel, up 30 cents."}

A lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and Apple's decision to offer more models has made it difficult to anticipate the number of components and handsets the company needs, according to the WSJ report  Apple shocked investors a few weeks ago with a sales forecast for the Christmas quarter below Wall Street expectations, prompting certain suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales. Screen maker Japan Display Inc ( ) cut its full-year outlook citing weaker smartphone demand, while British chipmaker IQE Plc ( ) said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year. Lumentum Holdings Inc ( ), AMS AG ( ), companies which supply Apple with software needed for its FaceID technology, also lowered their forecasts.

Apple shares were down 3.7 percent at $186.38 on Monday, while Lumentum, Skyworks Solutions Inc ( ) and Qorvo Inc ( ) were down between 2.7 to 6 percent. Forecasts have been particularly problematic for iPhone XR with Apple cutting its production plan by up to a third of the nearly 70 million units some suppliers had been asked to produce between September and February, WSJ reported. As recently as last week, Apple informed several suppliers that it had lowered its production plan again for iPhone XR, the Journal said. The company started selling its latest generation of phones, the iPhone XS and XS Max, in September and the XR model in October. Analysts at Cowen & Co expect a modest hit from iPhone production cuts on memory chipmakers like Western Digital Corp ( ) and Micron Technology Inc ( ).
