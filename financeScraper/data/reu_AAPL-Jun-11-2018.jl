(Reuters) - Apple Inc ( ) on Monday unveiled software upgrades that would let older iPhones run faster, help parents limit their children\u2019s screen time and make its Siri voice assistant work more like a rival feature from Amazon.com ( ). Taken together, the moves announced at Apple\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose amounted to focusing on keeping its base of 1.3 billion users satisfied with their devices and catching up with some competitors. Apple shares closed up 0.8 percent at $191.83 after the news, and rose to $192.40 in extended trading. Apple faced a backlash late last year when it emerged that the company slowed down some older iPhones with flagging batteries. The latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system for the iPhone and iPad, iOS 12, will make older devices, such as the iPhone 6, work better. Software chief Craig Federighi said iOS 12 could carry out simple tasks, such as opening apps, up to twice as fast as its predecessor, iOS 11. The new system will work on a range of products that date back to 2013. The company also will allow broader use of in-app voice controls, which it had limited to a handful of apps, such as PayPal and Uber. Amazon, by contrast, was much more open to controlling apps with its Alexa assistant. Apple also rolled out group video chat sessions with up to 32 users, putting it in direct competition with companies such as Cisco Systems Inc ( ) and Microsoft Corp\u2019s ( ) Skype. In response to criticism that Apple contributed to computer overuse by children, iPhone and iPad users will now be able to limit the time children spend in apps, as well as which apps they can use. \u201cSome apps demand more of our attention than we might realize,\u201d Federighi said. The parent control system sits atop a broader system that adults, too, can use to monitor and limit their screen time. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said the flexibility of Apple\u2019s system set it apart from others designed only for parental monitoring, offering the ability for teens and adults to impose their own limits. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear admission from Apple: \u2018Our installed base is so big, and no two users are the same, so we\u2019re not going to tell you what works for you,\u2019\u201d she said. New features help protect users\u2019 anonymity online. The company said its Safari web browser for both Macs and iPhones will keep users from being tracked without their permission by websites that use \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d buttons from social media companies. Apple unveiled new steps to make it hard for advertisers to distinguish among users, building on its effort, begun last year, to prevent such tracking. Apple also rolled out new tools for augmented reality, saying users would be able to share worlds in games, for instance. LEGO, the maker of interlocking toy blocks, showed off an app in which two players using iPads could put out a virtual fire blazing on a physical house made of LEGOs. Federighi said Apple had been working on a \u201cmulti-year\u201d effort to make it easier to move iPhone and iPad apps onto Mac computers, a significant change because Apple\u2019s iOS is often a top destination for developers, who frequently choose Android phones as the second platform. Federighi said the tools will come out next year.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "tick": "AAPL"}

Apple uses the guidelines to decide which apps can appear in the App Store. Apple now explicitly says apps cannot host anything that looks like an app store within an app or give users the ability to \u201cbrowse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user.\u201d But the new rules say that so-called remote mirroring apps, which beam the screen of a desktop computer to an iPhone, can allow purchases outside Apple\u2019s control as long as the transactions are processed on the desktop device and not the iPhone. The move is significant because it shows Apple protecting its practice of taking between 15 percent and 30 percent of the purchase price of software bought in the App Store. The company quietly posted new guidelines on Monday as its annual developer conference was happening in San Jose. Steam, the dominant online store for downloaded games played on Windows PCs, had planned to release a free mobile phone app called Steam Link so gamers could continue playing on their iPhones while away from their desktop machines. But Steam\u2019s parent company, the Bellevue, Washington-based Valve Corp, said last week that Apple had rejected the Steam Link app, blocking its release. Neither Steam nor Apple commented last week on why the app was rejected, and neither responded to requests for comment on Monday about whether the new App Store rules were indeed aimed at Steam. But Apple\u2019s update seemed intended to clarify the rules around what are known as in-app purchases or micro-transactions, in which gamers can spend small sums of money inside games to buy tokens, extra lives or others so-called digital goods. As with the purchase of apps themselves, Apple takes a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases distributed through its App Store. Analysts believe those purchases are among the drivers of revenue in Apple\u2019s services business, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Music. In Apple\u2019s most recent quarter, services revenue hit $9.1 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and providing a bright spot for revenue growth as the smartphone market matures.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "tick": "AAPL"}

The California-based firm has asked suppliers to make about 20 percent fewer components for the three new iPhones it plans to launch in the second half of 2018, compared to last year\u2019s plans for its iPhone X and iPhone 8 models, the paper reported. The report added to concerns that consumer passion for new editions of the iconic smartphones may be cooling after years of scorching growth, sending shares in Apple and many of its major suppliers lower and weighing on global stock markets. \u201cThis news needs to be viewed in the context of Apple probably being overly optimistic last year in relation to the prospects for its new phones, leaving it with excess inventory in the first part of this year,\u201d Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. \u201cAt least part of this lower order forecast probably relates to Apple just being a little more realistic.\u201d Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company sold 217 million iPhones, including its older models, in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It does not break down the figures by model and is still manufacturing large numbers of earlier versions of the phone. Factset and Thomson Reuters do not provide estimates for new model iPhone sales. Some analysts said they already expected Apple to sell fewer phones this year than last as global demand for phones tightens and competitors eat into its sales. The company sold 129.5 million iPhones in the past two quarters, little changed from the same period a year earlier. Apple\u2019s shares fell as much as 2 percent on the report, while those in suppliers AMS ( ) and Dialog Semi ( ) sank 6 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. Dialog\u2019s shares  had slumped 17 percent last Friday after it said Apple would cut orders for its power-management chips by around 30 percent this year. U.S.-based supplier Advanced Micro Devices ( ), Micron Technology ( ) Intel ( ), Broadcom Inc ( ) and Qualcomm Inc ( ) were all down between 1 percent and 4 percent. Many analysts have said the high price of the iPhone X - which sells for $1,000 and is the first iPhone to sport a new design since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015 - is also muting demand for the flagship. \u201cApple is quite conservative in terms of placing new orders for upcoming iPhones this year,\u201d said one of four industry sources cited by the Nikkei Asian Review. \u201cFor the three new models specifically, the total planned capacity could be up to 20 percent fewer than last year\u2019s orders.\u201d Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this week that Apple might cut prices of new iPhones to debut later this year by as much as $300, according to several media reports. Kuo said that Apple was likely to launch a 6.5-inch OLED \u201cIPhone X Plus,\u201d a second generation of iPhone X and an iPhone with a 6.1 inch screen. \u201cAs the improvements made to the iPhone each year become increasingly marginal it may become more difficult to convince consumers to pay up for the latest model, when an older generation device is effectively just as good,\u201d said Atlantic Equities\u2019 Cordwell. While media speculation about demand for the iPhone X swirled in the past six months, Apple\u2019s market value has continued to rise and is now within striking distance of $1 trillion. D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte also played down any fears. \u201cI am not overly concerned ... about the lower supply speculations,\u201d he said. \u201cApple is doing enough in general to keep the ball moving forward.\u201d The iPhone is by far the biggest revenue generating product from Apple. However, in an attempt to offset the impact of a weakening smartphone market, the company has been focusing on services as a path to growth. The unit, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter. For the fiscal year 2017, iPhones contributed 62 percent to the company\u2019s total revenue, while services accounted for 13 pct.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "tick": "AAPL"}

The company, which kicked off a three-day event on Wednesday to celebrate its 30 years doing business in China, already does much more than assemble goods for others. It\u2019s a top global producer of display screens, thanks to the acquisition of Sharp Corp. Its far-flung activities include autonomous car startups and investments in cancer research. But with its stock down almost 20 percent since late last year, Foxconn, Taiwan\u2019s second most valuable company with a market cap of $51 billion, is under pressure to show that it can convert new initiatives into growth. The Sharp purchase and a handful of more recent deals -including an agreement announced this week for Sharp to buy Toshiba Corp\u2019s personal computer business for $36 million - indicates that a push into producing its own branded products is one part of the strategy. Just as important, though, is a plan to provide integrated solutions for businesses that include both sophisticated hardware and software services such as cloud computing, Foxconn chairman Terry Gou announced at the company\u2019s 30 year anniversary celebrations in Shenzhen on Wednesday. This \u201cnew business model\u201d that could be especially appealing to smaller companies and institutions like hospitals, who have sophisticated technical requirements that they often have trouble handling on their own, Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn chairman Terry Gou, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cWe have built data centers for many of our customers, but we\u2019re not known to provide data center services,\u201d Woo said. \u201cIn the future since we\u2019re having all these pieces, we can put them together to provide a technical service to a business customer.\u201d The company is also betting that it can package its traditional expertise to sell \u201csmart manufacturing\u201d services, included fully automated factories, to other industrial companies. Woo acknowledged that none of this would happen overnight - a view shared by skeptical analysts. \u201cRight now, with the contract manufacturing, it\u2019s very hard to switch to a new model,\u201d said Vincent Chen, an analyst at\u00a0Yuanta\u00a0Investment Consulting in Taipei. And it has to be careful to keep current customers onside, in particular Apple - which is estimated to still generate around half of Foxconn\u2019s total revenue. \u201cThere will definitely be risks,\u201d in pursuing so many different areas, said Boyce Fan, an analyst at Trendforce. \u201cBut this will be key for Foxconn to find the next growth opportunity.\u201d FOCUS ON TECH AND HEALTH-TECH This attempt to pivot toward a new business model comes as trade disputes between the United States and China ratchet up. \u201cI don\u2019t think the current conflict between the United States and China is about trade, it\u2019s about technology,\u201d Foxconn\u2019s chairman Terry Gou said in a video that was broadcast at the ceremony on Wednesday in Shenzhen. \u201cRegardless whether we are talking about aeroplanes, ships or semiconductors, the United States is ahead of China so China needs to focus on designing and manufacturing technology,\u201d he said, noting that this was Foxconn\u2019s focus. He added that, among other things, Foxconn recently bought 20,000 textbooks about AI for all of its employees to study, including line workers and office secretaries. Gou also touted healthcare as a major new opportunity at Wednesday\u2019s opening ceremony. The company\u2019s technical strengths are in Sharp\u2019s high-resolution imaging and displays, which use the next-generation 8K standard and have ready applications for medical imaging devices such as endoscopes. Gou has also touted the possibility of smart toilets that can double as health diagnostic devices, Woo said, with sensors feeding data to the cloud for analysis. That would play to Foxconn\u2019s strength in 5G wireless communications equipment. Such efforts won\u2019t come cheap, and Foxconn is laying the financial and political groundwork for its next chapter with a Shanghai IPO for one of its main subsidiaries, Foxconn Industrial Internet. The $4.3 billion IPO will provide funding for initiatives in smart manufacturing, cloud computing, data centers and 5G  technology, among other areas. A number of Chinese state-owned companies are expected to participate in the deal. FII currently generates a big chunk of revenue from making comparatively mundane components such as smartphone casings and frames. And for all the talk of healthcare and cloud and AI, most of the IPO proceeds are earmarked for smart manufacturing. Sharp is also selling $1.8 billion worth of new shares to buy back preferred stock, issued to banks in return for a financial bailout. Meanwhile, the parent company has huge capital needs for the core display business, with new plants in China and the U.S. expected to cost almost $20 billion between them. It is still unclear how hard Foxconn will push its own products in the mainstream consumer electronics business, a hyper-competitive arena where sophisticated marketing is crucial. Fan at Trendforce says Foxconn could do more deals to acquire established brands. \u201cIt will use whatever branding there is already,\u201d he said, rather than try to build a Foxconn brand. The company earlier this year added to its brand portfolio with the acquisition of Belkin, a well-known U.S. maker of computer accessories. Chen, the Yuanta analyst, said Chinese smartphone juggernaut Xiaomi could be a model for Foxconn to emulate. He said Xiaomi is not only selling its phones and other products but also has a range of services to go with them, offered through their own stores. But Woo expressed caution: \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at how to go about doing that without any direct conflict with our current customers,\u201d he said. The world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer is planning long term, Gou said on Wednesday. \u201cOur future plan isn\u2019t a ten year plan, it\u2019s a thirty year plan.\u201d", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "tick": "AAPL"}
