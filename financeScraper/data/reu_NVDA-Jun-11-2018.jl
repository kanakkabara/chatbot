The ride-hailing service uses Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units known as GPUs, Huang told an audience on the final day of Nvidia\u2019s GPU conference in San Jose, California. \u201cUber does not use Nvidia DRIVE technology. Uber develops its own sensing and drive technology,\u201d Huang said in response to a question asked at the conference. The Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors. Huang\u2019s comments provide more detail as to the relationship between Nvidia and Uber, one of its many partners. Nvidia\u2019s shares have fallen by about 9.5 percent since the company said on Tuesday it was temporarily halting its self-driving tests on public roads out of respect for the victim in the March 18 accident involving an Uber self-driving vehicle. An investigation is ongoing. The chipmaker is continuing tests on closed enclosures, the chief executive said. Uber suspended self-driving tests in North America after an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Arizona earlier in the month.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "tick": "NVDA"}

The U.S. company best known for chips that enhance video game graphics has diversified into an array of businesses including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and digital mining, but investors are most concerned with its inroads in the market for cloud computing. Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s data center business, which powers cloud-based services such as Amazon.com\u2019s ( ) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp\u2019s ( ) Azure as well as Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( ) Google Cloud, rose 71 percent to $701 million. That missed targets of some analysts including Deutsche Bank, although it topped the Factset consensus of $656 million. The Santa Clara, California company for the first time disclosed that it made $289 million in sales - about 9 percent of its overall $3.2 billion in revenue - from chips for mining cryptocurrencies. Analysts had expected $200 million and the greater reliance on the fast-growing but volatile business contributed to shares falling 1.4 percent to $256.40 in Friday trade. Nvidia shares have gained 33 percent this year, propelling the stock to the top of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX. They touched a record high at $260.50 on Thursday before the announcement. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that the company expects cryptocurrency-related revenue to fall 65 percent to about $100 million in the next quarter. Retail prices for Nvidia\u2019s gaming chips surged earlier this year as miners snapped up chips, a development Nvidia addressed by releasing mining-specific chips. \u201cWhile supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing,\u201d Kress told investors on a conference call. \u201cGamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter\u201d were able to get their hands on new chips a reasonable price, she said. Analyst Kevin Cassidy from Stifel said the reliance on cryptocurrency concerned some investors. Moreover, he said, Nvidia\u2019s earnings were mostly in line with expectations, \u201cwhich may not be good enough for shares trading at 40x forward earnings.\u201d Data center industry sales have boomed as cloud services build out new facilities. Intel Corp ( ) last month said it had posted its biggest-ever quarterly jump in its data center business. For its part, Nvidia said it doubled sales of chips used by cloud companies for so-called deep learning. Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said he was not concerned by data center revenue because the buying patterns of huge cloud customers were \u201clumpy.\u201d Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s best-known business of gaming chips rose 68 percent to $1.72 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \u201cAt the core of it, gaming is strong,\u201d Chief Executive Jensen Huang told investors on the conference call. \u201cThe pent-up demand is quite significant and I\u2019m expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon.\u201d A cryptocurrency boom has powered growth at Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( ), but the sector is battling volatility caused by swings in the currency\u2019s value. Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s automotive business, which includes its Drive platform used in self-driving cars, rose 4 percent to $145 million, also topping analysts\u2019 estimate of $132 million. Nvidia in March suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] autonomous vehicle struck and killed a 49-year-old woman crossing a street in Arizona. But CEO Huang remained optimistic. \u201cI expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019,\u201d Huang told investors. The company\u2019s net income rose to $1.24 billion, or $1.98 per share, in the first quarter ended April 29, from $507 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $3.21 billion from $1.94 billion. Excluding items, Nvidia earned $2.05 per share. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $2.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "tick": "NVDA"}
