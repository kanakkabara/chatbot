IBM designed the supercomputer, called Summit, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty told CNBC on Friday. \"This is really one of our greatest achievements. It is the fastest, it is the smartest supercomputer,\" she said in an interview with Dominic Chu on \"Power Lunch.\" \"This is Watson's grandchild.\" Summit boasts a peak performance of 200,000 trillion calculations per second and will be eight times more powerful than America's current top-ranked system, Titan. It took four years to build, according to Rometty. For researchers, \"an experiment that might have taken 27 years to 13,000 years, they can do in a day,\" she said. \"You will have new compounds, new cures for cancer.\" Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the machine should have a profound effect not only on health care but on energy research and cybersecurity. \"This is nothing less than world-changing,\" Perry told \"Power Lunch.\" The U.S., which was in fifth place in terms of the world's fastest computers, will now move back up to the No. 1 spot, Perry said. But he expects China, which before Summit had the two fastest computers in the world, will work hard to reclaim the top spot. \"This competition is real. It's not going away,\" Perry said. For Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Summit is just the beginning of \"exciting\" growth ahead. \"The architecture for Summit is going to be the way computers are built in the future.

As a reminder for readers not familiar with my strategy, I am a dividend growth investor in my mid 30s with a long-term horizon (hopefully), and my plan is to invest in well-rounded companies with a quality track record, superb management team, and strong dividend growth potential.Towards the end of last year, numerous followers asked that I put out a list of stock picks for the year. As such, I constructed the list below with the goal to beat the performance of the SPY. The portfolio started with investable funds of $100,000 that were allocated amongst the stocks listed below. This portfolio will not be actively managed; however, I will provide commentary around any ideas or changes I would consider making. This piece will focus on our progress through the month of May, which saw a return of the bull market, after a rough start to the year. The portfolio got off to a rough first quarter, which contained the single largest point drop in the market ever. However, after a strong month of May from some of our top weighted picks, we are back in the black again.May 2018 ResultsThe beginning of the year saw a continuation of the long-standing bull market, however, things turned volatile starting in the month of February. Since the turn of the new year, the S&amp;P 500 has increased about 2.2% through the month of May, and decreased 0.3% since we made our selections on January 5th, which is when we locked in our picks. The month of May was the second-best month of the year, and really only the second positive month of the year as well, as April was essentially flat; a bit of a roller coaster to say the least. Geopolitical concerns still arise with renewed fears of a trade war, unrest in the Middle East, and talks with North Korea. Photo CreditIn addition to Geopolitical concerns, the Fed is once again turning hawkish as there are talks of a total of four rate hikes coming in 2018. Based on the strength of the most recent jobs report, reporting an unemployment rate of 3.8%, which is an 18-year low, I along with many others foresee at least two more rate hikes coming in 2018. This month we will almost certainly see the first of those hikes, followed by another possible hike in September and December. Many investors do believe the possibility of four hikes is strong, but I am going to stick with my prediction of three rate hikes for 2018.So without further ado, here are the May results for the Big Ticket 2018 stock picks. Source: Chart created by authorThrough the month of May, the portfolio has slightly outperformed the SPY by a mere 6 basis points. May was a strong month for the portfolio as we saw many of our top picks make strong moves we have been waiting for.Micron Technology (MU) was our strongest pick, as the stock gained 25.3% during the month of May. Micron initially was a hard-hit stock due to some weakness with chip stocks and rising fears of a trade war with China, which have subsided for the time being, leading to a run up in the stock price.Lowe's (LOW) was the next strongest performer during the month of May with the stock increasing 15.3% for the month. The company had a decent quarterly earnings report, which still lagged Home Depot (HD), but they hired a new CEO, Marvin Ellison to succeed Robert Niblock starting next month. Marvin Ellison will be leaving his role as CEO of JC Penny (JCP), which is not what got investors excited, instead, it was Mr. Ellison's 12 year history at rival HD that investors believe will help LOW close the gap. In addition to the new CEO hire, billionaire investor Bill Ackman had taken a roughly $1 billion dollar stake in the home improvement company, which saw the stock increase 10% after the news.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "tick": "NVDA"}

It is always pleasant to value Wall Street darling Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. At this point, the most common concern regards NVDA's seemingly high valuation, which may not be justified by its forecast fundamentals. In this article, I attempt to address this question. Based on the product classification, I used a \"sum of the parts\" method to estimate NVDA's target price for the rest of 2018.The good news is that Nvidia has fended off Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) recent assault on the GPU market and has been proven to be less affected by the volatility of the Bitcoin market. All segments across the board have delivered growth rates exceeding expectations. Ironically, Nvidia's only potential bad news may be a result of its own success. The smaller revenue share segment shows the largest growth potential; Datacenter delivered over 70% year-to-year revenue growth (Figure 3) but represents the smallest end user, contributing less than 22% to revenue (Figure 2).For the first time, Nvidia's GPU business, representing 86% of Q1 revenue, also dictates the company's 77% year-to-year revenue growth, which is significantly higher than the 33% Tegra Processor growth rate. As a result, Nvidia's near-term overall growth rate may show an unexpected improvement since the historical \"growth dilution\" from a large revenue base may not materialize this time. In the following sections, I will examine the 2018 growth outlook for Nvidia's largest or fastest-growing segments.GamingGaming is still Nvidia's largest revenue segment. It increased from 41% in 2015 to the most recent 53.7% (Figure 2). On the other hand, Gaming also has a lower growth rate than the Datacenter segment, although it has returned to an impressive level around 68% (Figure 3). However, gaming growth is expected to continue due to upgrades to chips that use Nvidia's Pascal and Maxwell GPU architecture. As the popularity of e-sports increases, the demand for mid-range/higher GPUs, the 3-5 years GPU refresh cycle, and matching product releases, the company expects that its gaming revenue will grow in a mid-teen rate. While the IDC predicts PC gamers will rise 4% a year throughout 2020, Nvidia's desktop GPU market share will reach 80% by then (Figures 4A and $4B). Since MAU is highly correlated with the desktop GPU sales, it stands to reason that Nvidia's long-term GPU's CAGR will be halved from the most recent 25% to 12%-14%. The company's gaming sales rose 13% a year during the past five years.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "tick": "NVDA"}

But there are other industries where self-driving vehicles are already being used.Mining, farming and construction were all ripe for implementing self-driving technology before it made its way to public transportation because they all largely take place on privately owned land in a more controlled environment.All three of these industries are also comprised of repetitive tasks with little to no variability. Dump trucks at construction and mining sites spend all day picking up dirt, driving it a short distance to dump it at a predetermined location, and then returning to the same starting point to do it all over. Tractors on farms go back and forth, tilling perfectly measured rows and planting crops. Again, an ideal environment for autonomous technology.Below we'll look at how companies in these industries are implementing self-driving technology.MiningRio Tinto (RIO), one of the world's largest mining companies, launched its Mine of the Future program in 2008. One aspect of the program has been implementing autonomous technology throughout the company's operations and controlling it via a centralized command center. Rio Tinto is doing that with trucks used to haul materials at the mine, as well as with trains used to transport ore from the mine to ports, where it is shipped throughout the world.By the end of 2019, RIO has said it plans to have more than 140 self-driving trucks in operation at its Pilbara site in Australia, up from the 80 it says it currently has in operation. The trucks Rio Tinto uses are manufactured by Komatsu (OTCPK:KMTUY) and they use a combination of GPS, radar and LIDAR (light detection and ranging) to navigate safely throughout the mine.Rio Tinto is also working on self-driving trains that carry iron ore from mines to ports for shipping, according to the company. In early 2017, the company started running autonomous trains, and recently announced that 60% of the distance traveled by its trains is autonomous, with a driver on board solely for supervision.Caterpillar (CAT) is another one of the major manufacturers of self-driving mining equipment. In late 2017, Caterpillar announced a deal with Fortescue Metals Group (OTCQX:FSUGY) (OTCQX:FSUMF) to supply the company with self-driving technology and upgrade 100 of Fortescue's Caterpillar and Komatsu trucks so they could operate autonomously. At its Solomon Hub mine in Australia, where Fortescue had already implemented an autonomous hauling system, the company saw a 20% improvement in productivity, according to CEO Nev Power.ConstructionOn construction sites, many of the tasks are similar to those in mining, and autonomous hauling trucks are used in both. However, construction sites can range from massive swaths of land down to small, single-family homes. While a dump truck making repeated trips might be necessary for building a new supermarket or housing subdivision, machinery with a little more finesse is often required for smaller projects.Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi (OTCPK:HTCMF) and Volvo Construction Equipment (OTCPK:VLVLY) (OTCPK:VOLAF) (OTCPK:VOLVF) (OTCPK:VOLVY) are four of the big manufacturers that have announced prototypes of self-driving construction equipment that can handle precise tasks like digging and grading. In addition, several startups have done so as well.One of them, Built Robotics, has been building self-driving construction equipment prototypes to be used for earth moving and grading services. The company estimates that in the U.S. alone more than $100 billion is spent on these services each year. Built Robotics was founded by Noah Ready-Campbell, who previously worked on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) self-driving car efforts, to develop solutions \"to address a chronic labor shortage, productivity that has fallen by half since the 1960s, and an industry that, despite significant improvements, remains the most dangerous in America.\"", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "tick": "NVDA"}

Shares of the iPhone maker hit record highs on Monday as its annual developer conference kicked off. Apple has long been the target of critics on Wall Street who worried about declining hype around the newest iPhones, supply chain issues and the like. \"But what these critics were missing is that Apple doesn't just have the most loved, best tech for its cellphones, it's got a razor-razorblade business model that can't be beaten,\" Cramer said. \"That means people buy the phone and pay for services directly from Apple or buy some of the developer apps on display today at the big conference and Apple gets a cut of each one.\" With a growing revenue stream and a massive cloud backup service that customers don't seem to mind paying for, Apple was a key factor in Monday's rally, Cramer argued. \"Apple's strength \u2014 the stock hit its all-time high again today \u2014 is exhibit A in the non-FANG romp,\" he said. \"It's kind of amazing that a company with a $943 billion market cap could really rally this hard.\" Cramer took note of investors' changing sentiments about the semiconductor space as shares of Nvidia, which makes chips for the data center, artificial intelligence, driverless car, machine learning and video game industries, reached an all-time high. Chipmakers' stocks had been under pressure since tensions with Chinese regulators stalled acquisition talks between Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors. \"It took a little bit, but ultimately, the market was able to draw a distinction between chip companies that are pure cellphone plays and the ones that aren't,\" Cramer explained. \"[Nvidia's] last quarter was spectacular, even if the sourpusses on Wall Street sold it off because the irrelevant cryptocurrency biz was soft. Sure didn't take long for the stock to bounce back.\" Shares of Microsoft also helped take the Nasdaq to new highs after the company announced it would acquire GitHub, a code-building and management platform for software developers. Microsoft's stock reached a 52-week high on Monday, settling at $101.67 per share. Cramer applauded the company's broad-based strength in personal computers, gaming and the cloud, commending CEO Satya Nadella for his savvy dealmaking. \"Microsoft has run, but I don't get the sense that it's overheating,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"We have an absence of news right now and absence is making the heart grow fonder for the stock.\" Cramer reiterated that Monday's widespread strength in the stock market wouldn't have happened without FANG. The tech giant's stocks still helped; it's just that others reclaimed the spotlight. \"Here's the bottom line: the Nasdaq was left for dead not that long ago, but turns out it was just resting,\" he concluded. \"Will it continue to roar? I think investors like these stocks the same way Willie Sutton liked to rob banks: because that's where the money is.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "tick": "NVDA"}

While any other stock being up 6.91% in the past 3 months and 35.55% YTD would be quite positive, it seems a bit dreary for a company that's up 75.32% year-on-year, over 1,100% over the past 3 years, and over 1,720% the past 5 years.Amid recent worries over what many thought was a temporary crypto boom in the company's Q4 2018 (our Q4 2017) earnings, Nvidia's Q1 2019 (our Q1 2018) earnings a few weeks ago settled those fears as GPU segments kept most of the gains they made in the prior quarter.Pulling out of its slump to now nearly an all-time high price of $262.28 per share, just below its $266.59 intraday high, Nvidia is now a $160.58 billion company with a P/E ratio of 45.17.Obviously at this level it will be unlikely for Nvidia to continue posting the percentage gains it has these past few years. Although processor hardware growth is expected to be strong in the upcoming few years, Nvidia's valuation growth in its boom this past decade has been more of it making a name for itself in the industry, and gaining market share, than just capturing the industry's growth itself.I remain optimistic for Nvidia, which at Tech Investment Insights' company ratings system deem to have a moderate risk-reward profile. Though its beginning to reach levels of scale where past growth levels remain unlikely, I think its P/E growth multiple is still rightly valued given its strong upcoming product and sector growth capture expectations. I'm optimistic for moderate levels of growth for Nvidia still to come.Nvidia's Rapid Path To A Tech Giant And How It May ContinueNvidia's path to its current valuation level has been partially a result of increasing its revenue, but much more so as a result of increasing its profitability.To compare, in the 2011 fiscal year Nvidia brought in $3.543 billion in GAAP revenue with $253.1 million in net income, for EPS of $0.43 a share and a margin of 39.4%.In contrast, in the 2017 fiscal year Nvidia brought in $9.714 billion in GAAP revenue with $3.047 billion in net income, $4.82 in earnings per share, and a gross margin of 59.9%.In short, in these six years Nvidia saw a gain in revenue of 174%, a gain in net income of over 1,100%, EPS gain of 1,020%, and its absolute margin level has increased by 2050 basis points.The stock price grew from $13.86 a share (no stock splits since) at the end of 2011 to $193.50 by the end of 2017, for an increase of 1,300%. For a company that had found itself in the gutter after collapsing from its highs in the 2000's, undoubtedly the past few years are really when its time has come.
