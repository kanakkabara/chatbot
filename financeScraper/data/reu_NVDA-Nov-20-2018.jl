The world\u2019s biggest maker of graphics cards for computer gaming pinned the blame for a disappointing holiday forecast on unsold \u201cPascal\u201d chips piling up with distributors and retailers after the evaporation of the cryptocurrency mining boom. Wall Street analysts, responding to Thursday\u2019s results, said poor sales were likely to continue for at least a couple of quarters until the generally well-reviewed Turing technology takes hold with software and hardware makers. \u201cWe think that history will show Turing as a breakthrough product,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote in a client note. \u201cBut it will take time for software to take full advantage of the chip.\u201d Shares in Nvidia were set to open at their lowest in a year, falling 18 percent in trading before the opening bell. At least 14 brokerages lowered their price targets on the company, with BMO Capital Markets the most dour, cutting its price target to $175 from $225. None of the 37 brokerages covering the stock cut their ratings, however. Twenty-six now have a \u201cbuy\u201d or higher rating on the stock and the rest are on \u201chold.\u201d Nvidia's Turing chips feature ray tracing technology that helps game creators to make real-time cinema-quality visuals by simulating the physical behavior of light. Electronic Art\u2019s ( ) Battlefield V, set for release later this month, will support Nvidia\u2019s ray tracing technology and a series of other blockbuster titles should follow next year. Turing-based GPUs have been widely stocked out in response, but in the transition Nvidia has also stopped shipping some of its mid-priced Pascal graphics processing units (GPUs) to retailers to reduce the inventory glut in its supply chain, weakening revenues. Nvidia said on Thursday it expected current-quarter revenue of $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $3.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "tick": "NVDA", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}

Nvidia Corp shares fell 18.2 percent in premarket trading after the chip designer blamed unsold chips piling up as the cryptocurrency mining boom fizzles out. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 7.5 percent and Micron Technology Inc, which sells memory to Nvidia for its gaming cards, declined 4 percent. Results for Applied Materials Inc, seen as a barometer for the chip equipment maker industry, also discouraged investors after its earnings forecast fell below Wall Street estimates. Its shares were down 10.6 percent. The weakness is likely to add to this week\u2019s pain for technology stocks, down more than 2.4 percent, hit by concerns about softening demand for iPhones, tighter regulation and a weakening chip sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index after gaining more than 35 percent each in 2016 and 2017, is down about 1.5 percent this year. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a downward sloping demand that is affecting the chip companies,\u201d said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR Inc, Fort Lauderdale in Florida. \u201cIt has something to do with the cryptocurrencies, but it has more to do with the lack of demand ... and technology is certainly the most endangered sector right now because of the very high valuations.\u201d At 8:48 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 167 points, or 0.66 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 20.75 points, or 0.76 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 91.25 points, or 1.32 percent. The S&P 500 snapped a five-day losing streak on Thursday, helped by a report that said Washington would pause further tariffs on Chinese imports. But hopes of a trade deal were dampened following a Reuters report later on Thursday that suggested a breakthrough was unlikely at talks expected between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina later this month. European markets struggled again as British Prime Minister Theresa May battled to defend her much-criticized draft divorce deal with the European Union as calls grew for a vote of no confidence in her leadership. In a gloomy week for retailers, department store operator Nordstrom Inc fell 10.9 percent after quarterly same-store sales missed estimates and the company reported charges from a credit card problem. Viacom Inc rose 3 percent after beating profit estimates, boosted by the strong performance of \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d and signing a multi-picture film deal with Netflix Inc. PG&E Corp jumped 47.5 percent, following steep losses in the past six days, after Bloomberg reported that a regulatory official said it did not want the utility to go into bankruptcy should it be found responsible for the deadly wildfires in northern California.

President Donald Trump said the United States may not have to impose further tariffs on China, but added the situation was still not acceptable to him. Stocks have been volatile as differing reports on the outcome of talks expected between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina later this month kept investors on edge. Wall Street opened lower after disappointing earnings from chip companies and retailers as well as Brexit-related concerns.

Taking some pressure off the markets were comments from new Federal Reserve vice chair Richard Clarida about U.S. interest rates nearing the central bank\u2019s estimates of a neutral rate. Analysts said Clarida\u2019s comments suggested that the Fed may be nearing the end of its tightening cycle. The bank typically stops raising rates once they hit the neutral level. Worries about rising interest rates, peaking corporate earnings and signs of a slowdown in global growth have prompted investors to sell off risky assets. After the S&P 500\u2019s weakest performance in seven years in October, stocks are still struggling to find footing. At 1:25 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86.05 points, or 0.34 percent, at 25,375.32, the S&P 500 was up 2.36 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,732.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 29.29 points, or 0.40 percent, at 7,229.75. Energy stocks rose 0.8 percent as oil prices recovered from sharp losses this week on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to cut output next month. In a gloomy week for retailers, department store operator Nordstrom Inc fell 14.7 percent after quarterly same-store sales missed estimates and the company reported charges from a credit card problem. Nordstrom was the biggest decliner on the S&P discretionary index, which fell 0.7 percent. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with utilities rising 1.2 percent as PG&E Corp jumped 38.5 percent, following steep losses in the past six days.
