Nvidia booth at 2012 Computex Taipei (via Flickr) Nvidia Takes A Tumble Post EarningsAt the end of August, when shares of Nvidia (NVDA) were hitting a new high, I presented two hedges for the stock. Now, after Nvidia's 18% drop following the downside guidance during its Q3 call Thursday, the stock is down nearly 41%. NVDA Total Return Price data by YChartsLet's see how the August hedges ameliorated this latest slide and talk briefly about what hedged Nvidia longs should do now. First, though, a quick reminder about the purpose of hedging: you hedge when you are bullish about a security (otherwise you wouldn't own it) but want to limit your risk in the event you were wrong. Nvidia longs who hedged in August didn't expect the stock to drop &gt;40%, but wanted to protect themselves in case it did.The August Optimal Put HedgeOn August 30th, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge Nvidia against a greater-than-20% drop by mid-March (optimal hedge screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app). Note that the cost here was $4,750, or 3.42% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts).Let's look at how that hedge has reacted to the 41% drop.How The Optimal Put Hedge Has ReactedHere's an updated quote on those puts as of Friday's close (via CBOE): How That Hedge Ameliorated Nvidia's DropNVDA closed at $277.81 on August 30. A shareholder who owned 500 shares of it and hedged with the puts above then had $138,905 in NVDA shares plus $4,750 in puts, so the net position value was $138,905 + $4,750 = $143,655.The stock closed at $164.43 on Friday, November 16th, down about 41% from its close on August 30th. The investor's shares were worth $82,215 on Friday, and the put options were worth $33,550, using the midpoint of the spread. So, the net position value as of Friday's close was $82,215 + $33,550 = $115,765. $115,765 represents a 19.4% drop from $143,655.The August Optimal Collar HedgeOn August 30th, this was the optimal collar to protect against a &gt;20% drop in NVDA by mid-March, while not capping your possible upside at less than 20% by then. In this case, the net cost of the hedge was negative, meaning you would have collected a $325 net credit, assuming, conservatively, that you bought the puts and sold the calls at the worst ends of their respective spreads.How That Optimal Collar Hedge Has ReactedHere's an update quote on the put leg of the collar (note that it's at a different strike than the first hedge):", "tick": "NVDA", "author": "David Pinsen"}

Even with the triple tailwinds of the rise of the stay-at-home economy, the rise of e-sports and the rise of in-game transactions, shares of Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive Software have been pummeled in recent weeks, losing 40 percent and 18 percent in value, respectively, since the end of September. \"Their stocks have both been tossed into the wood-chipper like Steve Buscemi near the end of Fargo,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said, saying that the explanation for this \"conundrum\" was complicated. In a nutshell, sales weakness at Activision Blizzard and fellow gaming player Electronic Arts has weighed on Take-Two's shares as exchange-traded funds that package the video-game stocks together dragged the cohort lower, Cramer said. \"Something has gone wrong at Activision Blizzard, [\u2026] but the smaller, more nimble Take-Two is doing great and I think it's insane that this stock has been hit so hard,\" he said. \"The market has clearly turned on the video game publishers and it's painting with a very broad brush, but Take-Two's doing great. I think you're getting a terrific buying opportunity, and every time Take-Two gets dragged down by weakness at Activision or Electronic Arts, you know what I'd do? I'd just buy more.\" Cramer will be seeking out \"man-made\" buying opportunities for investors in the short week before Thanksgiving Day. Some of these opportunities reared their heads Friday, he said. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told CNBC that the central bank should be more data-dependent and President Donald Trump said Chinese officials wanted to make a trade deal, both of which enabled stocks to pare their weekly losses. \"Immediately, there were questions about ... the validity or the sincerity of both of these statements,\" Cramer noted, referencing his own concern about the Fed's lack of rigor in its policymaking. He called Trump's statement on China a \"total wildcard,\" noting the White House's scramble to anonymously discredit the idea that they were close to making a new U.S.-China trade pact. \"Still, ... if the Fed declares victory in the war against inflation, ... and the president gets some substantive change from the Chinese, the market's going to come roaring back,\" Cramer said. \"On the other hand, if the Fed keeps beating the economy over the head with a series of rate hikes and the president's simply shining us on, then the industrials and the tech stocks will continue to get mauled by the bear.\" With that in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which includes key housing data and the last of the retail earnings reports. Click here for more. Coca-Cola's $5.1 billion acquisition of U.K. coffee chain Costa was less of an effort to take on giants like Starbucks than a move to create a new type of coffee experience, Coca-Cola President and CEO James Quincey tells CNBC. To Quincey, who joined Cramer for an exclusive interview Friday, the coffee industry has split into three overarching parts: the \"ready-to-drink piece,\" the \"at-home\" segment and immediate consumption at coffee shops. \"The biggest piece is in immediate consumption channels. And, actually, while coffee shops exist, the biggest piece is the rest,\" Quincey said on \"Mad Money.\" \"Helping other customers have a store in a store and executing coffee within other people's outlets is a big opportunity for them, and I think there's a lot of white space to do a lot better around the world.\" Click here to watch and read more about his interview. The breakdown in shares of Nvidia is a prime example of why investors should never fall in love with a stock, Cramer said Friday as shares of the chipmaker hovered near their 52-week lows. The stock plunged as much as 19 percent after Nvidia's third-quarter earnings report, which missed revenue estimates. Management's guidance was also lower than expected, pressured by crimped profitability and excess inventory in its cryptocurrency mining business. \"What do you do with it right now? If you didn't own Nvidia, it's too soon to start buying it,\" Cramer said of the company's stock, which he used to own for his charitable trust. \"There will be two more quarters of inventory problems.\" \"If you do own it, I think you need to recognize that it'll be a long time before this thing can come back. So if you can wait it out, you might want to if only because Nvidia still remains a great company and eventually they will get it right,\" he added. Click here for his full take. In Cramer's lightning round, he advised investors on their favorite stocks at lightning speed: Visa Inc.: \"You should buy the stock of Visa. [My charitable trust] almost did today. We almost pulled the trigger for ActionAlertsPlus.com.\" Tesla Inc.: \"You know, I was at a Tesla store the other day and the cars are beautiful.

The Nikkei share average ended 0.7 percent higher to 21,821.16. Last week, the benchmark index slipped 2.6 percent, hit by a drop in oil prices and tech shares. Analysts said that Nvidia Corp's dismal earnings, which triggered the tech sell-off, were now priced into the Japanese market, with investors scooping up chip shares on the dips. Tokyo Electron rose 3.6 percent, Advantest Corp added 2.2 percent and Screen Holdings surged 3.7 percent. Index-heavyweight SoftBank Group Corp, which tumbled 3.4 percent on Friday because it invests in Nvidia through its Vision Fund, bounced 5.1 percent. Also supporting sentiment was data showing Japan's exports rose 8.2 percent in October, reversing the previous month's decline, analysts said. It was slightly lower than a 9.0 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. \"Last month, the market had expected a rise in Japan's exports but they declined, so even though the October data missed market expectations, it was a reversal from the previous month so it was a relief to the market,\" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. Elsewhere, knitting machine maker Shima Seiki Mfg. jumped 10 percent after the company said it would buy back up to 1 million of its own shares for up to 4 billion yen. But banking and insurance tumbled 1.9 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, after U.S. yields fell when a top U.S. Federal Reserve official said on Friday that U.S. interest rates were not far off the Fed's estimate of a neutral level, suggesting that the current tightening cycle may soon end. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group sank 2.1 percent to hit a 14-month low, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed 1.9 percent and T&amp;D Holdings declined 3.5 percent. Appetite for financial companies, which seek out high-yielding debt, was also soured by the 10-year Japanese Government bond yield dropping to 0.090 percent, its lowest since late August.

But after seeing the numbers I think there's some bigger issues than just crypto channel inventories. I think their mid-priced RTX is going to have issues selling through. And Datacenter seems to have some issues.I think it's very important to understand a company's mix of business. As hyped-up people get about Datacenter and Auto, if Gaming isn't going to do it, you have a dead stock for a while. Gaming is almost 60% of the company. Auto is tiny and hasn't been moving much. And Datacenter has been slowing, maybe for some fundamental reasons. Let's review.Here's What We Said Ahead Of EarningsHere's what we said in a report last Monday,\"But there are some near-term headwinds. Channel inventories and a general video game slowdown in the US and China make this quarter and the guide a little tougher. Who doesn't want to own Nvidia? But this does not seem like a great time for an entry.\"Here's what we told subscribers in September when we downgraded from Buy at 275 (pay wall),\"I think the right October gaming growth can be low singles (percent sequentially) telling you that 10%-40% of sales growth are cut off by dropping cypto demand and too much inventory in the channel. I think Q4 is at risk to this too.The actual gaming growth sequentially for the quarter just reported was -2%, a big miss, even for us.It's Not Just CryptoOur note last Monday pointed out that reviews for the new RTX either complained that the high-end product is just way too expensive or the 2070 mid-priced product isn't worth the upgrade.But here's what CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said on Thursday's earnings call:\"It's all about crypto hangover.\"He was saying that the only reason for the miss is crypto inventory.I'm not so sure that's the only problem.We have no problem that the 2080 series is selling great, but that's the high end of the market. As we said Monday the high end is not big enough to drive the total pie for Nvidia.Over the last couple of years Gaming made up 55%-58% of overall business and 60% of the back half.They need to nail Gaming.You can read the negative industry reviews in our last report last week but I'd like to focus today on the ray-tracing reviews.Let's take a quick step back.Some of the slowdown of demand may have been gamers waiting for the RTX so that slowed channel-sell-throughs. Some of the slowdown though may be that there's a limited amount of ray tracing games available on the market. The thinking would be that when you have more choice of ray tracing games people will buy the GPUs.But there's also a problem that even when we have the ray tracing games, it still may not be worth it to upgrade.If that's the case, this problem was not just crypto.Let's see what Huang said on this: \"And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time.\"This is a must, right? If people are not \"enjoying real-time ray-tracing\" then Nvidia has a mass market problem. The mass market, which is most of their business, has to love that product. That's as opposed to high-end gamers who will probably spend anything on a GPU to compete.Let's see if they will \"enjoy real-time ray-tracing\" and let's see the reviews of Huang's call-out Battlefield V with ray-tracing enabled.Here's what Tom's Hardware had to say specifically about ray tracing for Battlefield V. \"There\u2019s also the question of if the game will look good enough to justify lower frame rates and a more expensive graphics card. But the game is available now, and the effects are mixed, at least to our eyes. ...but when playing the game\u2019s campaign or multiplayer while trying not to get shot, higher frame rates and resolution offer more benefit to the game than seeing light from an explosion bounce off the side of a tank.\" What Tom's Hardware was saying is that if you turn on ray tracing your game play gets hurt. You trade ray tracing for framerates. Do gamers want to lose their competitive edge in favor of seeing special shadows and reflections? Probably not.", "tick": "NVDA", "author": "Elazar Advisors, LLC"}

Shares of Apple Inc fell 2.5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the company has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September. The iPhone maker's stock is down 11.6 percent this month following the company's lower-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday quarter and a string of weak forecasts from several of its suppliers. Shares of Apple suppliers were also hit, with Lumentum Holdings Inc, Universal Display Corp, Cirrus Logic Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc down between 1.5 percent and 4.8 percent. The rest of the so-called FAANG stocks - Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc - shed between 3 percent and 1.3 percent. Micron Technology Inc fell 1.7 percent after a report that Chinese authorities have alleged \"massive evidence\" of antitrust violations by the world's top three memory chip makers - the latest industrial spat that threatens to upset global trade relations. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index dropped 1.1 percent, extending losses from the previous session after an underwhelming forecast from Nvidia Corp weighed on the sector. Eight of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were lower, led by a 1.9 percent decline in technology shares. At 9:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96.70 points, or 0.38 percent, at 25,316.52, the S&amp;P 500 was down 11.02 points, or 0.40 percent, at 2,725.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 72.18 points, or 1.00 percent, at 7,175.69. Over the weekend, Asia-Pacific leaders failed to agree on a communique for the first time ever at a meeting in Papua New Guinea with U.S.-China trade worries on the forefront. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday the United States will not back down from its trade dispute with China, and might even double its tariffs, unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands, dampening Friday's trade optimism that was fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's comments. \"Markets are a little bit cautious with regard to the comments that Pence made over the weekend and the fact that they couldn't get a communique out of APEC meeting,\" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc, seen as trade sensitive stocks, fell 1.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively. China's JD.com Inc slipped 6.2 percent after reporting third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on sluggish sales in its core e-commerce business. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The violent swings in the near-term results seem to be tied to the crypto boom and current bust, as the long-term thesis of a great positioning regarding artificial intelligence remains intact in my eyes.Consequently, I am constructive on the name, but find the valuation still a little bit too steep, despite a near 50% recent correction.About The Promise Of NvidiaNvidia claims to be perfectly positioned to benefit from secular growth trends. While the company is most known from its gaming business, it has a fast growing datacenter business, as well as pro viz and automotive business as well.It has been these developments and execution upon the promise of these trends which has provided an absolute boost to the share price in recent years. Remember that this was just a $20 stock in 2015 as shares have seen a crazy momentum run just a few dollars shy of the $300 mark as recent as October of this year.Following a near 20% pullback in response to the third quarter results, and the pullback seen in recent weeks already, shares have lost nearly half of their value, now having fallen to $165 per share. Investors have not seen these levels for about a year by now.Note that the company is currently already in its fiscal year of 2019 as it has seen incredible growth in recent years. In the fiscal year of 2017, sales were up by 38% to $6.91 billion, with revenue growth accelerating to 41% as sales hit $9.71 billion in the fiscal year of 2018. First quarter sales in 2019 rose by 66% to $3.21 billion. Revenues growth decelerated to 40% in Q2 with revenues hitting $3.12 billion.The problem is that third quarter sales growth slowed down to just 21% with revenues amounting to $3.18 billion. The core gaming business grew sales by just 13% as that business still makes up 55% of total sales. Most other areas have still seen decent growth with professional visualisation revenues up 28% to $305 million, datacenter revenues growing by 58% to $792 million, and automotive revenues up 19% to $172 million. OEM &amp; IP revenues fell by 22% to $148 million.Understanding Investors' CautionWith revenues somewhat flattish between $3.1 and $3.2 billion in the first three quarters of this year, this marks a violent break from the impressive growth numbers reported in recent years.The company cites continued advancements of AI across the globe, driving mostly the datacenter business of Nvidia, while the weaker times for crypto-currencies have been hurting near-term sales in other parts of the business.The company has seen some pressure on margins as well. While non-GAAP margins were still up 130 basis points for the year, margins are down 250 basis points from the second quarter. Combined with operating expenses being on the increase, the very fat operating profit margins have seen some pressure, but still come in at 38.0% of sales. While margins are similar as Q3 of last year, they are down 330 basis points on a sequential basis.Amidst lack of interest expenses and a very low tax rate in the single digits, adjusted earnings of $1.15 billion closely track operating earnings of $1.21 billion. One-time benefits from tax reform boosted the results, as we really ought to adjust for $140 million in stock-based compensation expenses as well, being a real expense for investors. If I adjust for that earnings come in closer to a billion, or $1.60 per share.Outlook Is ProblematicI can hear you think. Having fallen to roughly $160 per share, and with realistic quarterly earnings trending at $1.60 per share, realistic annualised multiples come in at 25 times. For one, for potentially one of the best positioned technology names that is not a very high valuation. This is certainly the case as the company net holds $5.6 billion in cash, or about $9 per share, reducing multiples further to 23-24 times earnings.", "tick": "NVDA", "author": "The Value Investor"}
